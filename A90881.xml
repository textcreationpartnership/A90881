         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat in the Frontiſpiece of this Treatiſe, there are humbly preſented to your Honours and this Nation, a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe many deſirable conſequences, which will follow upon the practiſe of this enterpriſe; is not, that I (ſo inconſiderable an inſtrument) do delight in profesſing things ſtrange or unuſuall, (which to doe, were neither rare nor difficult) being very ſenſible, that great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings do many times weaken the credit of the beſt Authors, far more of ſuch as my ſelfe, even to the rendering of their Propoſalls by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, to be caſt off as imposſible, before any due triall or deliberate exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof.</p>
            <p>But obſerving, that in regard of the diverſity of your weighty affairs, the multiplicity of books, and the vanity wherewith they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fraught, your Honours have juſt cauſe to be diſcouraged from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of any books, except ſuch as (at leaſt) ſeem to be of ſome ſpeciall concernment, I thought it neceſſary (though with much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, leaſt I ſhould exceed in expresſing the particulars) to premiſe a ſummary of the ſeverall advantages, which would, as J conceived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſolid grounds, appeare to be the neceſſary effects of this attempt, as
<pb facs="tcp:170618:3"/>it may be managed in a way, that is not onely practicable, but free from much difficulty and danger to the Undertakers, or any damage at all to others.</p>
            <p>In confidence therefore, that your own wiſdomes will direct you to ſuppreſſe all prejudice, that might ariſe from the conſideration of the great deſparity betwixt any ſuch as my ſelf, and that which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, untill by a ſerious peruſall of the whole work, your Honours be able ſo far as need ſhall require upon juſt grounds, to reject what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</p>
            <p>And having nothing to expect, but (which to crave would imply a greater willingneſſe in me then in your Honors) even a furtherance of this work, ſo far forth as in your diſcretions ye ſhall judge the good of this Commonwealth to be therein concerned; there remains onely the reaſons for making publique, and thereby expoſing to the view of all Nations, a work of ſuch a Nature, as if being firſt ſet on foot by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people in the world before our ſelves, may through multiplying their ſtrength put them into the better capacity to diſturb the peace of thoſe who not having alſo imbraced the ſame, are the leſſe able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves; as was well objected by a member of Parliament, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honorable.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, it is to be conſidered, not onely that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tendeth (if I may in this allude to thoſe words of the Apoſtle in another caſe) to provoke to emulation thoſe who are my fleſh, and thereby to ſave them; but that the undertaking it ſelf is of ſuch a nature, as to have attempted any thing therein, without firſt preparing the minds of men, by publiſhing a ful and free deſcription of the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, with the myſteries thereof, the manifold reaſons for the ſame, the ſolution of doubts, and anſwer to objections, would through the ſubtil inſinuations of thoſe who deſire not the proſperity of this diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, have occaſioned (without queſtion) many fair pretences, to have been ſpread abroad, for ſtifling the ſame at the very birth.</p>
            <p>And the rather, in regard that as innocency needs no corner, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious men deſire to be guided by their own light, in things which themſelves are to practiſe, inſomuch as the want of full ſatisfaction to all men (which without printing could not eaſily have been given) might both amongſt your Honours, and thoſe that ſhould engage in this undertaking (beſides others) have been interpreted a juſt ground of jealouſie.</p>
            <p>Whereas an accompt of the whole being firſt divulged, if this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould then ſlight that, which other people make a profitable uſe
<pb facs="tcp:170618:3"/>of; the guilt which otherwiſe truly (I being perſwaded in conſcience of the reality of the thing, would have been heavy upon my ſelf) doth no longer lie at my doore, whatſoever the event ſhould be.</p>
            <p>But to remove this danger of being prevented by other Nations, I have yet (as by the ſequell doth appear) concealed one principall Adjunct, the ignorance of which, will make fruitleſſe the endeavours of any, that without further direction, ſhould either here or in any other part of the world, undertake this practice; wherein, notwithſtanding when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, I ſhall not faile (God willing) to give full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And although upon publication thereof, I conceive it not neeeſſary, to ſeek any Priviledge, Pattent, Broad ſeal or the like, as other Authors upon ſuch occaſions (in reference to the ſatisfaction of their manifold expences of time, pains, trouble, charges and hazard, which in ſuch enterpriſes are not uſually ſmall) apprehend they have juſt cauſe to do.</p>
            <p>Yet (Renowned Patriots) it is not, for that in this endeavour, I have been leſſe necesſitated to any of all theſe inconveniences, then others in ſuch caſes generally are; but rather being confident (from experience) that if any within your Honours Juriſdictions, offer ſo great an affront to Juſtice, as (endeavouring to reap what others have ſowed) ſhould thruſt themſelves into thoſe imployments, which are pertinent to this undertaking; your Honors will aſſuredly vouchſafe, upon an appeal, to interpoſe your Authority, whereby to ſuppreſſe all ſuch attempts, and that in as ample and effectuall manner, as if the ſame had been deſired, before any publication of this Enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>All which, was in duty thought fit, to be humbly ſubmitted to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and grave conſideration of your Honours, By him,</p>

            <p>And for attaining this end, in ſuch a way as the ſame might conduce moſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and with leaſt difficulty and hazard to the enriching of the people, with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt accompliſhment of all earthly comforts, that either Land or Sea could afford; I endeavoured to bring the ſame to paſſe (if poſſible) by that, which in all reſpects might be equivalent to a Myne of gold, diſcovered within their own Territories, yet without the inconveniencie of being a temptation to any other Nation or people in the world, to invade the Land, either for ſurprizing ſuch Treaſure, or enabling them to maintain a warre thereby, in caſe they ſhould.</p>
            <p>Now, as amongſt all other objects that center in this earth, the pitching my thoughts at this ſeaſon upon this, was not without a ſpeciall providence; ſo neither could it be without the ſame ſpeciall direction (which uſually in greateſt matters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth the weakeſt means) That I (ſo unlikely an inſtrument) ſhould in a thing of ſo great importance, be carried on from time to time, untill now at laſt, to diſcover e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as much almoſt as in this particular I could have wiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> how all things which may be got for gold throughout this earth, are obtainable in all reſpects as happily and effectually, (yea and in a way tending to as great improvement of Trade, as is before mentioned) even by a means, though with ſome difficulty and hazard, yet in reference to the advantages thereof, ſo eaſie as may be admired; and (as a worthy Member of this Common-wealth well obſerved thereupon) may ſerve to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the vanity, not onely of gold, but of all Worldly Wealth whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Yet being very ſenſible of the prejudice of people againſt any thing that is new; and which (though never ſo needfull) doth not agree with their own fancies; I have been often exceedingly diſcouraged herein, &amp; almoſt diſſwaded from going on in the work: But on the other ſide, taking into due conſideration, how fully not only mine owne conſcience, but the judgement of divers judicious men, (who have had ſome knowledge thereof) are convinced and ſatisfied, that it is no Chimera or Dream, but really that which wants nothing but meer performance of ſome things, which to be done, are as fezible and facill, as in reference to a thing (I ſay) of ſuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and advantage can be expected, to make it prove an effectuall remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent ſad calamities of this Nation, almoſt in all particulars; I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and therein found abundant comfort, to hazard much precious time, with other the advantages relating thereunto, in the not onely perfecting of this inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but digeſting it into the fitteſt words for other mens underſtanding, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deſign ſo far as poſſibly I could, for the ſetting of it on foot.</p>
            <p>Yet, whether God will grant ſuch ſucceſſe to my endeavours in this enterprize, as
<pb facs="tcp:170618:4"/>the thing it ſelf doth ſeem to promiſe, though otherwiſe for mine owne part, I ſhall (for ought I know to the contrary) ſuffer great prejudice, I am not much carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, nor dare I make it my dependence; but this is my comfort (which the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of this life cannot deprive me of) that at the worſt, I ſhall but ſuffer in doing ſome part of that work, which I am confident I was by eternall providence, brought upon the Stage of this world to act.</p>
            <p>This one thing notwithſtanding, I could beg with tears of all my Countrymen the people of this Land, that (laying aſide prejudice, pride and fancy) they would judge, and act in this particular, no otherwiſe then as they ſhall by ſound and ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be convinced; and then I am certain, that as by thus judging, they will be forced to acknowledge a remarkable hand of God, in profering ſo ſeaſonable a mercy; ſo by thus acting they ſhall be ſafe, from daſhing upon the dangerous rock of refuſing ſuch profers.</p>
            <p>And truly to the proud humour of man, the meanes may ſeem ſtrange and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, but being effectuall, it appears to me that there is the more of God in it, who though (in his very eſſence) he be bounty it ſelfe, yet his bounty being alſo juſtice, it delights him to tender the greateſt of his bleſſings in ſuch a way, as it requires true humility in us, to be willing to accept what is freely profered by him.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as this diſcovery extending it ſelf naturally unto all things, which relate to outward good, cannot be made cleare to the different apprehenſions of men, without anatomizing (or as it were, ripping up to the very bowells) the principles and methods of that Fabrick of Devices, which ſome thouſand years experience (promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the unlimited deſires and innumerable motions of mankind) have produced, for the obtaining, preſerving and increaſing of riches, peace and ſafety to themſelves and Poſterity, in reference chiefly to that principall meanes conducing thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> [Trade,] which is indeed the main policie whereby people are not only, either enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or impoveriſhed, the poore maintained or deſtroyed; but even all Eſtates and Common-wealths, either eſtabliſhed or undermined, as I ſhall hereafter have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve.</p>
            <p>In this reſpect therefore, though the book be ſomewhat large, I deſire it may be conſidered, that the Subject is no leſſe copious; and (ſo far as I perceive) hath not been (in reference to Trade) fully treated heretofore.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to expreſſe my mind, in as few words as conveniently I could, yet ſo as (being for the moſt part to trace an untroden path) I preſumed to be rather ſomewhat ample, then any waies deficient, either in leaving out things neceſſary, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over things ſuperficially (without a full and cleare proofe thereof) or not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any objection material, which I could imagine, might (poſſibly) in the leaſt meaſure lie as a ſcruple in the minds of any.</p>
            <p>I have ſtudied to proceed in order, beginning firſt with thoſe things which are moſt liable to vulgar obſervation, being as the grounds and foundations whereupon the whole Edifice is erected; which I obſerved not only for Method but neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Conſidering, that in teaching any Art or Faculty, it would be very prepoſterous to begin with things moſt difficult, and furtheſt from common reach; As in teaching Arithmetick to begin with Fractions, Coſſick Numbers, or the finding of Square and Cube Roots, before the learner bee skilled in Addition; Or as in teaching Navigation, to begin with ſhewing the nature of the Rumbes, in reſpect of the various Circulation of thoſe Lines, which each Rumbe (by making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall angles with every Meridian) doth deſcribe upon the ſuperficies of the earth and Sea, even before the Student be perfectly grounded in the cleare and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſeverall points of the Compaſſe: or in brief, as if in teaching the <hi>word of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170618:5"/>truth, the Preacher ſhould immediately <hi>go forwards to perfection,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>without firſt laying the foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (courteous Reader) for theſe reaſons, not having put that in the firſt place, which happily thou mighteſt have expected, I earneſtly deſire thee to exerciſe ſo much patience and diligence as to read this book throughout, in ſuch order as it is compoſed; otherwiſe, I cannot but fear that by miſapprehenſions, through want of neceſſary preparation, (in things as eſſentiall to this diſcovery, as the principles, rules, and beginnings of any Art, are to the utmoſt perfection thereof) thou wilt be ready ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to condemn (or at leaſt to ſlight) what elſe upon due conſideration thou wilt be forced to acknowledge, is amongſt earthly things one of the moſt neceſſary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable both to thy ſelf and thy Countrey.</p>
            <p>Yet in regard, that (according to what hath been already hinted) many men look upon all Inventions, whilſt they are <hi>new</hi> (though never ſo needfull or profitable) as meer
<hi>conceipts</hi> or <hi>whimſies,</hi> as they are pleaſed to call them; in reſpect whereof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it neceſſary, to vindicate this and all ſober attempts from ſuch aſperſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to the matter it ſelf: I muſt therefore in few words, intimate ſome things here, which may ſerve to demonſtrate the folly of all thoſe, who ſuffer themſelves to be infected with this ſtrange kind of humour.</p>
            <p>In order to which, let it be obſerved, that Arts being no other then the fruits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſon, applyed to the diſcovery of things profitable, cannot receive their birth without
<hi>Invention;</hi> ſo as whatſoever is ſpoken to the diſparagement of Invention, doth tend to blemiſh not onely any one Student or Profeſſor, together with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; but even laies the axe to the root of Art it ſelf; and by conſequence, to all manner of learning.</p>
            <p>Which brings to my memory, what a worthy Author teſtifies concerning ſuch as did profeſſe themſelves to be skilfull and experienced Navigators; that it was uſuall with them (in a jeering manner) to call thoſe men <hi>Sun-ſhooters,</hi> whom they perceived to obſerve the <hi>Latitude</hi> at Sea, by taking with an inſtrument the <hi>Suns Meridian Altitude,</hi> before the practice thereof was common: yet not long afterwards, (to their great diſparagement) they were forced to proclaim their own folly, (a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment not unſuitable to the offence) by ſubmitting to practice themſelves, that which at firſt, they ſo unadviſedly ſcoffed at, in others.</p>
            <p>And what think you, would even the ſame Sea-men have ſaid, if they had been privy to his device, who firſt thought of the making of Ships, like houſes, to ride upon the Sea, with ſuch huge Maſts and Sails, as to abide therein, would ſeem (if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary were not daily experienced) a far more deſperate adventure, then to dwell in Manſions, built with high and large extent in the upper parts, upon a foundation more fickle then that of Sand? Yet how not only practicable, but profitable, the uſe of ſhipping is to the ſervice of mankind, would require a volumne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Invention,</hi> whenſoever it produces any thing <hi>New,</hi> muſt needs be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for preſenting the world with <hi>Toyes</hi> and <hi>Guegawes,</hi> what ſhall we ſay then of him who firſt buſied his brains to deviſe that admirable and fundamentall Art, the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all articulate ſounds to Letters, and Letters to writing; the rare effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as is reported) makes the ſavage Indians to be exceedingly amazed.</p>
            <p>In brief, were it not madneſſe to condemn either the finding out of Printing and Weaving, or of thoſe curious inſtruments of Art, ſuch as Clocks, Mills, Cranes, Pumps, with many ſuch like, (divers whereof coſt men addicted to Invention, no ſmal pains to make practicable) becauſe at firſt, the uſe (no doubt) of ſuch artificiall devices (amongſt thoſe, whoſe dull capacities (like Carriers horſes) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb facs="tcp:170618:5"/>(though the caſe be never ſo extraordinary) to be beaten out of the common roade of ſuch apprehenſions, to which they have been long accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeemeth for the moſt part ſtrange, if not idle and fooliſh: who having their opinions in theſe particulars, not governed by ſound and ſolid reaſon, muſt needs (herein) be left to the miſguidance of ſuch fantaſtick dreams, as they Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Authors of thoſe excellent Arts.</p>
            <p>For, is it not manifeſt, that the only reaſon, why we in theſe parts of the earth (ſo long inhabited) do ſo much deſpiſe the rude kind of life, incident either to the firſt ages of the World, wherein Men differed little from Beaſts, (living upon Roots and Acornes,) or now to the brutiſh people of <hi>America:</hi> Is it not (I ſay) meerly becauſe we are by Art furniſhed with thoſe Accommodations, which nature alone, (without improvement by the uſe of mans Reaſon) could never have affoarded unto us?</p>
            <p>But (Courteous Reader) having too long detained thee in the <hi>Entry,</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abruptly deſiſt, and refer thee to the Treatiſe it ſelf; being really</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough heavenly things ſhould beyond all proportion, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before earthly, yet where they are both conſiſtent, neither of them ought to be at all neglected; for as the Earth ſince the Fall, requires much skill and diligence to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to the beſt advantage for outward ſubſiſtence, ſo until matters be ordered in ſuch ſort, as all men that are willing to take pains in an honeſt Calling, may be put into a capacity of enjoying a Lively-hood thereby; No man can be excuſed, who (knowing any means tending thereunto) doth neglect either to diſcover the ſame, or endeavour the effecting thereof.</p>
               <p>Having therefore, in reference to the duty I ow to this Nation, determined to demonſtrate thoſe remarkable things (for leſs I cannot juſtly call them) which by many degrees, and at ſeveral times, were by Divine Providence dictated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as moſt pertinently conducing to the end before expreſſed: I find it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to begin with <hi>A Diſcovery of the means in general, which tend either to Further or hinder a Peoples comfortable Subſiſtence, by their Induſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170618:10"/>In order to which, it is to be obſerved, that as in the Body Natural, no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can ſubſiſt by it ſelf, without both ſerving the whole Body, and receiving (as a reward of ſuch publique ſervice) a competent nouriſhment from it; So in the Body Politique, no Artificer or Tradeſ-man can accommodate himſelf, with all things neceſſary to a comfortable ſubſiſtence, by his Induſtry in any one Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without tranſmitting the over plus of the fruits of his endeavors therein, to other the Members of the ſaid Body Politique, and from them receiving inſtead thereof, a proportionable reflex of the ſurpluſage of their labours and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>Hence it is evident, that though a Land be never ſo fruitful of it ſelf, and ly never ſo fit for the Trade of Fiſhing and Traffick with other Nations, yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities therein cannot be improved and multiplyed, without the Induſtry of men in their ſeveral proper Callings; nor can any man afford this Induſtry faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then he can find means for the Exchange of the fruits, of his own labours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> poſſeſſions, inſteed of ſuch other neceſſaries as for his Trade or Family, he ſtands in preſent need of; and conſequently in caſe of deadneſs in Trading, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſlacken his endeavours, leſt by taking in and preparing more Ware for ſale, then he knows how quickly to diſpoſe of, it ly upon his hands, till it be quite out of faſhion, grow ſtale, or be otherwiſe ſpoyled, to his great prejudice.</p>
               <p>For, if Trading be ſo obſtructed, as men cannot put off (poſſibly) the tenth part of that Ware in the yeet, as for money or valuable conſideration they could procure and prepare for ſale: In this caſe as the Merchant cannot afford to bring in Comodities ten times faſter, then the Retayler can take them off his hands; ſo neither can the Retayler take them off faſter, then he can find ſale for what he hath already; in ſo much, as if either the Whole-ſale man or Retayler ſhould have a ſtock of goods, as great as when Trade was ten times quicker, it muſt needs follow, that they would be ten times as long in ſelling it: whence (as I ſaid) it would be ſpoyled, by lying upon their hands.</p>
               <p>Whereas, if there were a way found, whereby men might put off their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for valuable conſideration, even as faſt as they could prepare them, it would occaſion their returns to be ſo quick, and ſuddenly ſo great, and likewiſe ſo encourage all men, to employ the utmoſt of their Stock and Credit, in ſuch a thriving way, as the ſtore and plenty of all ſorts of Ware, would ſoon amount to the greateſt extent, that the Land and Sea by the Art and Induſtry of men, could poſſibly be made to afford; and each man (I ſay) being in preſent capacity to put off the ſame for valuable conſideration, it would not onely prevent the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of having ſo great a ſtore of Commodity ſpoyled, by lying upon his hands; but by multiplying his riches through ſuch quick Returns, enable him to beſtow a comfortable maintenance upon Himſelf and Family, whereby the Commodity thus augmented, is (through the enlargement of mens expenſes) diſtributed amongſt them, towards their comfortable ſubfiſtence, as faſt as it is thus encreaſed in quantity.</p>
               <p>For, ſeing that the effect of all Trading, is but the parting with Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for ſuch Money, Credit, or valuable Conſideration, as procures other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities or Neceſſaries inſtead thereof; whereby each mans Ware being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from himſelf, he in concluſion receives other Ware or Neceſſaries for it; it follows that the more Commodity they after this manner transfer each to other (ſeing upon one mans parting with it another receives it) the more they receive each from other.</p>
               <p>And again, it being hereby handed from one to another, till it be at laſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170618:10"/>unto perſons for their private uſe, towards the comfortable maintenance of themſelves and Families, it comes to paſs, that if by this means they exchange each to other, every yeer as great a quantity of Commodity, as the Land and Sea by the utmoſt endeavours of men can be made to afford, they muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one yeer with another towards their ſubſiſtence, no leſs; ſo as the Earth affording but Commodity enough, both the fruits of their Induſtry, and as a reward thereof) their enjoyment of outward good, ſhall be proportionable to the open and ſtree paſſage that is made, for ſpeedy putting off their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties one to another.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being duly conſidered, it is manifeſt, that if there were (I ſay) any poſſible means, whereby men might put off their Commodities even as faſt as they could prepare them, and that for valuable conſideration <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch a way as whereby in lieu of the Commodity ſo parted with, to receive each from other, that which will procure ſuch other Commodity of like or greater value, as for their Trade or Family they ſhould ſtand in preſent need of.</p>
               <p>Seing that in this caſe, (they being (I ſay) able to put off their Commodities as faſt as they can procure them, for valuable conſideration, and it being ſo much for their profit ſo to do, (they would not ſpare to improve the Earth to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that it could be made by Wit or Induſtry to yeild, it could not produce any other thing, then to occaſion that all this plenty of Commodity, (multiplyed by the joynt endeavors of ſo great a number of men,) would be in ſuch ſort transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from one to another, as by that means it would be diſtributed to every indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious man, as the reward of his labours, towards the encreaſe of his Stock, and comfortable Maintenance of his Family, even proportionable to his diligence in the Multiplication, Improvement, or Diſtribution of ſuch Commodity, amongſt the reſt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, that mens increaſed endeavours are in this caſe rewarded, by the increaſed quantity of Commodity, which hereby they are in capacity to ſhare amongſt them, it follows that (eſpecially in a Land which is not onely plentiful of it ſelf, but lyeth fit for the Trade of Fiſhing and Traffick with other Nations,) nothing ſo much hinders a peoples comfortable ſubſiſtence by their induſtry, as when matters are ordred, ſo as they cannot find a way to put off their Comodities, as faſt as they could procure or prepare them for ſale; and that the contrary, would tend as much to further their comfortable ſubſiſtence by ſuch induſtry, which were the things here to be diſcovered: and though perhaps generally obſerved, yet (the cauſes, grounds, and nature of them not being ſo obvious) the cleering thereof, could not be omitted, in the ſound handling of a ſubject of this kind.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S he alone is ſaid to be wealthy, who hath not for the preſent only, but for ſome time to come, meanes of ſubſiſtence for himſelf, and perhaps for his poſterity; ſo he that hath greateſt poſſeſſions for the preſent, if for want of good Improvement, he ſpends out of the main Stock is not like to enjoy ſo much of his wealth, as he whoſe Eſtate though as yet but ſmall, is in a fair way of thriving.</p>
               <p>Seing therefore, little wealth would ſerve, if it were onely for preſent ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and conſidering that continuance of wealth, conſiſts cheifly in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereof, it follows that except the ſaid improvement, do but juſt maintain the charge of the Improver, (which ſeldome ſo remains long in an even ballance;) it doth either more then maintain that charge, whereby it is not only continued but increaſed, or leſs then maintain it, whereby it is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved; ſo that it is with wealth much as it is with fire, which cannot lightly be upheld, but by the ſame means by which it is increaſed.</p>
               <p>And even as (I ſay) with fire, the greater it is, (a ſufficiency offewel being added to it) the more violently it doth increaſe it ſelf, by the exceſſiveneſs of its heat; ſo it it is with riches, for the greater a mans eſtate is, (he not wanting means to improve it) the faſter doth ſuch eſtate multiply, by the ſuper-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of his profit.</p>
               <p>And contrarily, when a mans eſtate is ſo ſmall, as the improvement thereof will not ſerve to maintain his charge, it follows, that ſpending out of the main ſtock, ſuch waſted ſtock is like to yeild the leſs improvement upon the ſecond return; whereby he being forced ſtill to ſpend, ſo much the more out of the principal, his eſtate muſt needs decay ſo much the faſter, by how much the leſs it is.</p>
               <p>Now, though this be a thing that haply hath come, within the compaſs of moſt mens obſervations and experience, yet I thought good to mention it, for that being applyed to the purpoſe hereafter expreſſed, it ſerves to demonſtrate the fickle condition not of particular perſons only, but of whole Nations.</p>
               <p>For as the wealth of a Nation is greater or leſs, according to the value of the eſtates, (whether in goods, money, lands, or whatſoever elſe) of thoſe men that live therein; ſo the end to which the riches of a Common-wealth ſerveth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo much the preſent, as future preſervation of earthly injoyments (which cannot be without the improvement thereof, by the profit of the yearly return of their ſtock;) it followes that except this return, do yeild exactly ſo much encreaſe, as doth but juſt maintain their charge, out of the profit of each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, (which ſeldome happens to be of long continuance) it muſt either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their wealth, (and conſequently put them into a capacity by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170618:11"/>ſtock, to encreaſe it yet more then formerly) or diminiſh their eſtates, by forcing them to ſpend out of the main ſtock, ſo as their profit upon their leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtock, being every year leſſe, and conſequently their expences out of this ſtock every year more, (and therefore alſo their profit yet leſs) ſuch a people muſt without effectual meanes of prevention be uſed, be inevitably brought to utter beggary.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be ſuppoſed by him, who hath not duly weighed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the decay of ſome perſons in a Common-wealth, is ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage unto others, and the thriving of many a prejudice to the reſt, yet if the particulars following be well conſidered, it cannot but be granted, that (contrary to this miſtaken imagination) as on the one ſide the decay of rich men, and the multiplying of the poor, is by the impairing of trade ſo much the greater prejudice unto all that cannot live, but by their paines in ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſo on the other ſide, that the multiplying of the rich, and the diminiſhing of the poor (which is effected by a quick Trade) doth (by encreaſing the annual expences, conſequently the trade of a Nation) occaſion no damage to any, but much advantage to all.</p>
               <p>And the truth of this, will appear to ſuch as ſhall conſider, that when a people by the abundance of their trading, are become generally ſo exceeding rich, as thoſe who now need no trade to maintain them, are perhaps ten times as many as the other; their yearly expences (in not only family maintenance, but feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Journyes for recreations, and all ſuch like comforts and delights, therefore alſo their trading) is perhaps ten times greater, then of thoſe, amongſt whom the major part do live upon the charity of Tradeſ-men, and few or none rich enough, without a trade to live.</p>
               <p>For, (I ſay) according to a people expences, ſuch is their trading, (ſeing it is impoſſible their ſhould be more ware put off in the year, (exept what is ſent to other Nations) then the people do one time with a nother, ſpend amongſt themſelves, Families and Freinds; whereby it comes to paſs, that if a Nation be ſo extream poor, as they are not able to affoard themſelves a competent liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood; in this caſe though the land wherein they live be never ſo fruitful; yet, the revolution of commodities through the hands of Tradeſ-men, that is Trade, (and conſequently induſtry) being hereby obſtructed; it followes that both Tradeſ-men are ruined, the people as much diſtreſſed as if they lived in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſoile; and (for want of the many imployments occaſioned by Trade) the generally of them, enforced to ſpend all their own Stock, and perhaps more, which they have borrowed of others, for their preſent ſubſiſtance, whereby the poverty of ſuch a people, being by ſuch poverty ſo much the more encreaſed, and conſequently (I ſay) their Trading and imployments, ſo much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, they are, (without ſome effectual meanes be uſed to remedy the ſame) put out of all hopes of recovery.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, though a people through the ſuperabundancy of their riches, ſhould ſpend upon the comforts of this life, never ſo many thouſands in a day one with another, yet by this meanes, there is the more commodity ſold, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Trade is the greater, conſequently each man in much better capacity to gain abundance of imployments, with competency of lively hood thereupon, then if there were not in that Land, (by the univerſal poverty of the people) ſufficient practice for one man in an hundred: ſo as by the riches of the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of men, not only the rich themſelves, are put into a capacity to enjoy the fruites of the earth, but by the current of commodities to ſuch rich perſons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170618:12"/>through the hands of Tradeſ-men, ſuch Tradeſ-men are inriched, and by a multiplycation of imployment, (by reaſon of the abundance of Trade) the poor maintain'd.</p>
               <p>Now from all this, that which I ſaid before is evident; <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame meanes by which for the moſt part, the wealth of a Nation is preſerved, is no other then that, by which it is increaſed, ſo as it is almoſt impoſſible that it ſhould continue long at one ſtay, without growing either greater or leſs.</p>
               <p>For, if a people be at once generally ſo poor, as their yearly expence in a competent maintenance of themſelves Families and Freinds, is not great enough to make Trade ſuch, as whereby Tradeſ-men one with another, may get ſo much as will maintain them, ſuch a people (nothing preventing) muſt needs grow every year poorer then formerly, till both Trade and Stock be reduced to nothing; and that ſo much the faſter, by how much the more their riches, and conſequently their trading is hereby decreaſed.</p>
               <p>But, if the generallyty of a people be once ſo rich, as their yearly expence is ſuch, as makes Trade to affoard ſomething more then a meer ſubſiſtance to Tradeſ-men; the Stock of ſuch a Nation, that is their Riches, therefore their Trade doth yeerly increaſe; and each encreaſe making a greater addition to the Stock, and by conſequence to the Improvement, it goeth on, nothing interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting, till, like fire that wants no fewel, it be able to drink in, even ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity yeerly, as all the Merchants that live upon this Globe of the Earth, are able to procure, and willing to afford for money,</p>
               <p>And this when once Trading comes to be ſomthing quicker then ordinary, much the faſter, for that Tradeſmen by reaſon of their great and quick Returns, growing ſuddenly very rich, leave off their practiſce, and others from nothing falling into imployment, and from imployment to ſtock, and from ſtock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a way of quick trade, do ſoon arive unto the ſame condition; whereby the number of ſuch who are ſo poor, as not being able to follow a trade, muſt live upon the charity of others to the burden of the Common-wealth; being dayly diminiſhed, and the number of ſuch as become ſo rich, as they need no trade to maintain them; being dayly increaſed; the charge of the Common-wealth in maintaining ſuch poor, is not onely leſſened; but Trade, by the encreaſe of ſuch rich, ſo much the more multiplyed, the number of ſuch rich, by ſuch quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened trade, ſo much the faſter encreaſed; and Trade thereby again ſo much the more multiplyed: and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Security for making good, Mens Eſtates, which is uſually called <hi>Money,</hi> being given to Perſons for their Commodities, upon no other accompt, then as an <hi>Evidence</hi> or
<hi>Teſtimony,</hi> to ſignifie how far forth men (by their joynt Agreement to take it, being otherwiſe of no worth, for Commodities of real value) are Indebted for, and engaged, to recompence the fruits of their labours or poſſeſſions, in ſome other Commodities or Neceſſaries inſtead of thoſe, that for ſuch money they parted with; it comes to paſs, that he who hoards up this publique Obligation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demanding preſent ſatisfaction in one way or other, doth (as he well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) grow every day poorer then formerly, by living upon the principal Stock.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, it is, that there are very few, who though they be of no Trade, and though the times be ſomthing dangerous, can afford to keep their Eſtates, or any conſiderable part thereof by them in money, but either, they let it out for Intereſt, buy land with it, or ſome other waies employ it, ſo as the principal may yeild an advantage; and much more, muſt men that live by their Trades, the improvement of whoſe Stock is their maintenance (being generally not long able otherwiſe, to defray the charges of houſe-keeping) rid their hands of money for Ware, as faſt as they receive it.</p>
               <p>Now, from this confideration, it is evident, that in reference to a Common-Wealth, or any Society of men, the greater quantity there is amongſt them, of money, credit, or that which is taken by them for Commodities, the more commodity they ſell, that is, the greater is their Trade: For whatſoever is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken amongſt men for commodity, though it were ten times more then now it is, yet if it be one way or other layed out by each man, as faſt as he receives it, it muſt needs come to paſs, that (reſting no where) it doth occaſion a quickneſs in the revolution of <hi>Commodity</hi> from hand to hand, that is Trade, proportionable to the greatneſs of its quantity.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that if the Stock of moneys, which drives a Peoples Trade, ſhould every day encreaſe, yet (granting that matters were ſo ordered, as men would not hoard it up; and then (it muſt needs follow, that by every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual putting off ſuch money from himſelf, (endeavouring alwaies to keep his whole Eſtate, if poſſible, in Ware or Commodity) they (as by a Sluce) do by degrees draw in ſuch a flood of goods amongſt them, from Land and Sea, as their Wealth in other things, will far exceed their Stock in monies, if none of them do reſt (as it is ſuppoſed they do not) until each of them hath ſo convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eſtate into goods, as the money he hath in his hands, is not conſiderable thereunto; for when once it is ſo, it muſt needs follow, that what they are worth in money (though never ſo much encreaſed) is not valuable to what they are worth in goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170618:13"/>Hence it is, that in any Nation where money is not hoarded up, that if all the Houſes, Ships, Goods, Lands, and whatſoever elſe is any part of any mans eſtate, were prized but at an ordinary rate, the total ſum would no doubt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the value of all the moneys, that is in their whole Land an hundred fould; whence it neceſſarily followes, that though money be never ſo much encreaſed amongſt them, yet by each mans endeavouring not to keep any conſiderable part of his eſtate by him in money, their eſtates in Ships, Houſes, Goods, or the like, are multiplyed proportionably.</p>
               <p>And this encreaſing of goods in a Land, by the encreaſing of money therein, comes to paſs by this means, that one mans putting off of money from himſelf, for Ware, is not onely the furniſhing himſelf with another mans commodity; but the putting that other man in preſent capacity, to refurniſh himſelf from Land or Sea, with ſome new commodity, by parting with that money which will produce the like effect, for a third perſon, and ſo perpetually.</p>
               <p>Hence, when the ſtock of a people in monies doth ſo faſt increaſe, as Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have (as I may ſay) much a do to keep the current of moneys, which then runs amongſt them (it growing daily greater) at that low proportion, in reference to their goods, which by each of their conſtant endeavours (upon their reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moneys every day anew) is purſued; In this caſe then, they ſo ſtrive (as it were) to put off the money one from another in ſuch great proportion, as trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes ſo quick, that Tradeſ-men returning and conſequently gaining, as much perhaps in a moneth as otherwiſe in a year (and this gain being converted into goods, by each mans putting off the money for it) they dayly encreaſe their wealth ingoods, if not immediatly proportionable to ſuch an encreaſe of money; yet until this be effected (in regard they never reſt ſtriving, to put off the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney one upon another (to the drawing in of new commodities and encreaſing their trading, conſequently their Wealth in goods, ſo as all the money they have amongſt them, will not be conſiderable to the value thereof, their eſtates muſt needs (if not totally arive, yet) perpetually haſten towards the aforeſaid porportion, and that (the world affoarding but commodity enough for money) ſo much the faſter, as by reaſon of ſuch ſwift encreaſe of monies, it wanteth time to comefully up thereunto.</p>
               <p>But contrarily, in a time of Civil or Inteſtine wares, rich men as faſt as they receive money upon any occaſion, knowing not how to diſpoſe of it, either by laying it out in Land, commodity, or otherwiſe; ſo as whereby to ſecure their eſtates from the danger of ſurprizal, do uſually keep it up in their own poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and by conſequence, obſtructing the revolution thereof, do thereby hinder Trade, by preventing the ſale of ſo much commodity, as by the current of ſuch money from themſelves, through the hands of others, muſt needs have bin returned: and Trade being once obſtructed by what means ſoever, doth make men find by ſad experience, that if they keep as great aſtock of ware by them now, as when trade was quicker, it muſt needsly much longer upon their hand, till hapilily it be growen ſtale or out of Faſhion.</p>
               <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that when through hoarding up of moneys or any other meanes, the quick current of trade is ſuddenly and conſiderably abſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, though a people be at that time never ſo rich, and live in never ſo fruitful a Land; yet ſuch as have their ſtocks in commodity, much more then proportia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſo decayed a trade, do upon their recieving monies keep it, or the moſt part of it by them, without maintaining their ſtock in goods, to the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as formerly; by which meanes, the current of money, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170618:13"/>of Trade; being yet ſo much the more obſtructed, doth occaſion (men keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the leſs ware by them) to convert ſo much the greater part of their eſtates into moneys, whereby, the revolution thereof, and by conſequence Trade, is yet ſo much the more abated; therefore men induced to hoard up moneys ſo much the more; and ſo on, till the eſtates of all rich men, being in a maner wholly converted into moneys, and the generallity of the people drained of it, they muſt needs in the end (if this courſe go on amongſt them) expect ſuch a total obſtruction in the current of moneys, as they may well wait in their ſhops, without receiving one with another, neer ſo much as may ſerve to preſerve them alive, though they ſpend all they take, both Principal and Profit.</p>
               <p>Hereby, the quantity of goods that is amongſt Tradeſ-men diminiſhing, not onely in the hands of the rich, by their dayly endeavours to convert their eſtates into moneys; but alſo in the hands of the poor, by their being perpetually forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſpend out of the main ſtock, for their meer ſubfiſtance; (if this courſe (I ſay) go on) men who were formerly worth (perhaps) one with another 20. times as much in commodity as money, ſhall ſcarce have any thing but money amongſt them; and yet their money no whit encreaſed, ſo as they muſt needs be ſo much the poorer, by how much their eſtates in goods are diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that as on the one ſide, mens endeavours to poſt off money one upon another for commodity, by a conſtant ſtriving to keep their whole eſtates (if poſſible) in goods, (eſpecially, if ſuch money dayly encreaſe amongſt them) do multiply their trading, &amp; by conſequence their riches, ſo as the world affoarding but commodity enough, &amp; that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other nations, though their own ſoile be never ſo barren, their eſtates in goods, will ſoon by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees exceed the value of all the money, that is ſo revolving amongſt them, though never ſo much encreaſed; and on the other ſide, mens hoarding up of monies, or endeavouring to convert their eſtates into money; doth by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing trade, make men ſpend out of the main ſtock, more and more, till ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, though never ſo rich formerly, and living in never ſo fruitful a Land, they have ſcarce ſo much commodity left amongſt them, as is equal in value to their ſtock of money, which being alſo for the moſt part hoarded up, by the richer ſort, affordeth no advantage to the generallity of the people.</p>
               <p>Thus, the cauſes or means to make a <hi>Poor people,</hi> though in a barren Land
<hi>Rich,</hi> and a <hi>Rich people</hi> though in a fruitful Land <hi>Poor;</hi> do manifeſtly appear, which were the things here to be diſcovered.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe, the full force and vertue of that <hi>Expedient</hi> for inriching a poor people, which I ſhall hereafter propoſe; depends cheifly upon the <hi>Effect,</hi> which money being not hoarded up, but multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a fruitful Land, doth produce amongſt them; that it may the better appear in what proportion, an encreaſe of money not hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, doth encreaſe trade, and multiply mens eſtates in any land, where Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity enough by the fruits of its own ſoile, and Traffick with other Nations, is to be had for money; let it be ſuppoſed, that there is a people amongſt whom there is now, ten time as much money as formerly (or rather that money might be multiplyed amongſt them to any quantity required) that matters were ordered ſo, as none of them care to hoard up this money, that their land being fruitful and fitly ſituate for the trade of Fiſhing, and Traffick with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there is commodity enough to be had for money, though trade were 100. times greater then now it is; and then I ſay the conſequence will be, that both trading and riches will encreaſe amongſt them, much more then propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to ſuch encreaſe of money, and that without encreaſing the price of commodity, as I ſhall prove in place convenient.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for Trading (I ſay) though their money be but ten times more then formerly, their trading ſhall be neer 100. times more then formerly: for if this multiplyed ſtock of moneys, would in this caſe revolve, about in neer the tenth part of that time, as their former ſmall ſtock would have done, (which I ſhall prove it would) it followes, that there is a double advantage in it: The firſt is, in that being ten times greater then the former; each revolution thereof (commodity not being dearer) cauſeth full ten times as great a ſale of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, that is full ten times as great a Trade, as each revolution of the former ſmall ſtock would have done.</p>
               <p>And therefore further, if this multiplyed ſtock revolve about, in neer the tenth part of the time as the former ſmall ſtock would have done (that is neer ten times about for the others once) it followes, that men receive neer 100. times as much money, in the ſame ſpace as formerly; conſequently, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity not being deerer, their trade is neer 100. times as quick as formerly if at leaſt, there be not a greater number of Tradeſ-men then formerly; which if there be, then (ſeeing it is ſuppoſed, that money may be multiplyed to any quantity required) let it be encreaſed accordingly, and the effect ſhall be ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>So that, what is here ſuppoſed being granted, and it being proved, that in this caſe commodity ſhall not riſe in price, there remaines nothing to be cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that hereupon it would follow, that this multiplyed ſtock of moneys, ſhall revolve about in neer the tenth part of that time, as the other ſmall ſtock would have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:170618:14"/>In order to the demonſtration whereof, it is evident, that if the quantity of money amongſt a people in any Nation, be once ſo great as being diſperſed, that which they have one with another, is a ſum very conſiderable to lay out in a way of Trade; in this caſe, every of them thinking to imploy his whole ſtock, laies out that confiderable ſum, which he already hath without intermiſſion; and their doing this without delay, is that whereby they receive each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame ſums again with as little delay, and by that meanes do put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into preſent capacity to do the ſame, the ſecond and third time, and ſo perpetually.</p>
               <p>For ſeeing, their thus puting off the money one upon another (though they perform it with never ſo much ſpeed) cannot make the quantity of money that is amongſt them the leſs, it muſt needs follow, that they have in their hands ſtill one with another, ten times as much money as formerly, that is, a conſiderable ſum, to lay out immediatly in a way of trade.</p>
               <p>Whereas, when all the money amongſt any number of men, is of ſo ſmall a quantity as being diſperſed, that which they have one with another, is not conſiderable to imploy as a ſtock in away of Trade, (and much leſs to purchaſe Land, put out to entereſt, and the like) in this caſe, every man deferring to lay out that little which he hath, doth in a manner totally obſtruct the current of that ſmall ſtock, which is amongſt them; whereby it is manifeſt, that this inconſiderable ſtock of moneys, ſhall not revolve about in the tenth part of that ſpace of time; as (by each mans ſtriving at once to put off his own ſhare from himſelf) that other great ſtock doth.</p>
               <p>Therefore, (I ſay) this multiplyed ſtock of moneys, ſhall revolve about in neer the tenth part of the time, as the other ſmall ſtock would, and conſequently trading be in this caſe neer 100. times as quick as otherwiſe; that is increaſed much more then proportionable to ſuch increaſe of money, which was the firſt thing here to be proved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be demonſtrated was; that they ſhall hereby ſuddainly multiply their riches, to be more then proportionable to ſuch encreaſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, (I ſay) ſuddainly; for though (I confeſs) it is impoſſible, that by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of money mens eſtates ſhould be increaſed proportionably, in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant without any intermiſſion, yet money being encreaſed to be now ten times more then formerly, (ſeeing that hereby trade could not chooſe but be neer 100. times more then formerly, as is already proved) it muſt needs follow, that mens returning 100. times as much commodity in the ſame ſpace as formerly, would ſo exceedingly haſten the increaſe of their ſtock, and conſequently their eſtates in commodity, as their wealth in Goods would quickly reach to the utmoſt extent, that the world for money could affoard.</p>
               <p>And having ten times as much money amongſt them as formerly, though they had alſo already ten times as much Goods as formerly, yet that is no argument to prove that they would be content to keep, ſuch conſiderable ſums by them as through this meanes (every mans proportion one with another being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by ten) would be diſperſed amongſt them: for though their ſtock be but yet ten times as much as formerly, yet they find ſale for 100. times as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity as formerly, whereby they would ſtand in need of a ſtock of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditys proportionable, ſo as untill (at leaſt) they had increaſed their ſtock proportionable to their Trade, they would never reſt poſting off the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney each upon other, with the greateſt ſpeed poſſible; which as I have already proved is the very meanes, whereby a Common-wealth though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170618:15"/>ſo barren of it ſelf, is ſuddainly enriched with plenty of Commodities.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing again, that though the money thus multiplyed ſhould ſtand at that ſtay, without being further encreaſed, yet Trade once quickned (as is already proved) having a property by multiplying the number of the Rich, and thereby the expences of the people, to encreaſe it ſelf like fire, to the utmoſt extent poſſible; it followes, that a ſtop in the encreaſe of money, would no more occaſion a ſtop in the encreaſe of Trade, then forbearing to blow the fire after it is ſufficiently kindled. would prevent its further encreaſing, ſeeing it is evident, that (as it is with fire in this praticular) by how much the more it ſhould be hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by ſo much the faſter it would ſtill go on to encreaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the ſecond thing which was here to be proved, doth follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the caſe before premiſed, mens wealth in goods as well as commodity would ſoon be above ten times more then formerly, that is, more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to ſuch encreaſe of money; and that ſo much the ſooner, if money alſo ſhould in the mean time be yet further multiplyed: for then, though Trade like (I ſay) as fire, when it hath gotten ſtrength) is apt enough to encreaſe it ſelf, yet will do it ſo much the faſter, if it be (as it were) intended and forced (like the ſame fire with a ſtiffe and feirce wind) by the multiplying of money ſtill to a greater quantity, (I mean) that though, by the perpetual encreaſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amongſt men, their eſtates might poſſibly never come to be above ten tims more then the money, which they at preſent have amongſt them; yet by the ſaid encreaſe of money, their eſtates would ſo much the ſooner be above ten times more then all the money, that lately they had amongſt them.</p>
               <p>By all which, the efficacie of this meanes, for making a <hi>Poor people</hi> (ſuddainly)
<hi>Rich,</hi> doth more fully appeare, which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore, as it is no wonder why there is ſo much care taken by all States, to prevent the exporting of coyne, who have not any mine of gold or ſilver at their own command, ſo the truth of what is affirmed by one Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> of late, in a book of his, called

               <p>Which therefore to do, with as much brevity as poſſible, I ſhall in this <hi>Section</hi> (before I come to the full clearing of all other ſcruples in the next) prove <hi>that nothing can be alleaged againſt the aforeſaid meanes, for inriching a poor people; but what argues as ſtrongly againſt an increaſe of Trade amongſt them, though it be at preſent never ſo dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then, in oppoſition to what is thus undertaken to be proved, it ſhould be objected, that an increaſe of money would occaſion an increaſe in the price of Commodities, proportionable to ſuch increaſe of money, (that is, if the money were twice as much, Commoditie would be twice as deare) conſequently (go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never the further in Commodity by the increaſe thereof) would not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion any increaſe in the ſale of Commodity: therefore not any increaſe of Trade; and yet (by cauſing the price of Commodities to riſe) incur an inconvenience, contrary to what is before affirmed.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the Objection, (though for the better clearing of this point, I thought it not fit to be omitted) implies no leſſe then a contradiction; ſeeing it is evident, (or at leaſt by the ſequel, ſhall be put out of all doubt:) That an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of money cannot poſſibly occaſion an increaſe in the price of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, otherwiſe then by increaſing the ſale thereof, and that (as hath been already alleaged) if ſuch money being doubled, the price of Commodity be thereby alſo doubled, ſuch increaſe of money doth not in this caſe increaſe the ſale of Commodity: It followes, that it is no occaſion of increaſing the price of Commodity at all: Therefore, to ſay that an increaſe of money, doth by occaſioning a greater ſale of Commodity, occaſion ſo great an increaſe in the price thereof, as not at all to occaſion an increaſe in the ſale thereof, is (I ſay) a plain contradiction: whereby it is manifeſt, that an increaſe of money, cannot occaſion an increaſe in the price of Commodities, fully proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch increaſe of money.</p>
               <p>Again, if it were ſo, yet this would incur no inconvenience, as in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is intimated; For ſeeing, though Commodities ſhould be upon this occaſion twice as dear, yet there is alſo twice as much money diſperſed amongſt men; whereby they are in as good a capacity to purchaſe as great a quantity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170618:16"/>of Commodity, as if, having but half that money, it ſhould go twice as farre; ſo that the inconvenience, is no whit greater then the advantage.</p>
               <p>But to admit, that an increaſe of money, muſt needes occaſion a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable increaſe in the price of Commodities, as it is already made evident, that it would imply a
<hi>Contradiction:</hi> ſo it is manifeſt, that there is a great <hi>abſurdity</hi> in it: For either a people, having now ten times more money amongſt them then formerly, though they have alſo ten or 100. times more Commoditie, yet in this caſe, Commodities muſt needes be now, ten times dearer then formerly; or elſe a people, though they have now ten times more money amongſt them, then formerly, cannot poſſibly have more Commodity amongſt them then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; either of which to affirm, is (I ſay) abſurd, and contrary to the truth of what, will fully appear in the <hi>Section</hi> following: Neither indeed, if this were truth, could the hoarding up of monies, which is equivalent to a decreaſe thereof in quantity, occaſion a decreaſe of Commodity (as by what hath been ſaid, appeares that it doth) and by conſequence, an increaſe in the price thereof.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, that ſince the diſcovery of the <hi>Mynes</hi> in the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> (whereby the world hath been filled, more full of money then formerly, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are likewiſe growen, much dearer then formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> confeſs, that if there be now ten times more money, in the World then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; ſeeing it cannot be conceived, that the whole world is capable of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ten times more Commodity then formerly, it muſt be granted, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of money in the whole World, may occaſion an increaſe in the price of Commodities, (though not fully proportionable, neither to ſuch increaſe of money; for it doth not appear, that Commodities are ſo many times dearer, as money in the world, is now of late yeares multiplyed) yet ſeeing matters may be ordered ſo, as the whole world may be able to afford, ten times more plenty of Commodity to any one Land or Nation then now it doth, (&amp; eſpecially if the ſame Land might be improved ſo, as to yield much more Commodity out of its own Bowels, then for the preſent through the extream poverty of the People, and deadneſs of Trading, men can find ſale for:) in this caſe if the money in that Land, were ten times more then it is, it might ſoone come to paſſe, that there would be ten times as much Commodity to be ſold for money; whereby the price thereof, (as <hi>I</hi> ſhall have occaſion hereafter to obſerve) would be kept from riſing: And thus, this ſcruple (<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe) is fully removed.</p>
               <p>To proceede therefore, to the proofe of what is before aſſerted: <hi>I ſay firſt, that an encreaſe of money, cannot poſſibly occaſion an encreaſe in the price of comodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (or any other Inconvenience) but by increaſing the ſale of Commodities</hi> For an increaſe of money can produce no evill, but what it doth by augmenting the quantity of that, which is either
<hi>kept by</hi> or <hi>layed out:</hi> The quantity of that which is <hi>kept by,</hi> being Augmented, doth (indeed) imbolden men to ſpend the more freely, through which as people live the more Comfortabely; ſo the ſale of Commodity (that is <hi>Trade</hi>) is ſo much the quicker; but beſides, this (I ſay) the Increaſe of that which <hi>lyes by,</hi> occaſions no Inconvenience, other then if it were ſo much <hi>Braſs</hi> or <hi>Lether</hi> lying by, except what it doth by hindering the ſale of ſo much Commodity, as by the currant thereof would be returned; yet this Inconvenience is not to be imputed to the Increaſe of money, but rather to the contrary, for that ſo long as it is kept by, it is all one, as if it were not increaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170618:16"/>Now, that on the other ſide, by increaſing the quantity of what is layed out, it produces no evill, other then what it doth by increaſing the ſale of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity (that is <hi>Trade</hi>) this is moſt evident and unqueſtionable, Therefore, this firſt thing to be proved, <hi>viz. That an encreaſe of money cannot poſſibly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an encreaſe in the price of Commodities, (or any other Inconvenience) but by encreaſing the ſale of Commodity, is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then to proceed, from hence it followes, that if it were impoſſible for money to increaſe in any place, without increaſing the price of Commodity, it would be as much impoſſible for Trade to increaſe in any place, but the price of Commodity, muſt needes alſo increaſe in that place; Seeing it is here proved, that an encreaſe of money, cannot poſſibly increaſe the price of commoditie, or incurre any other inconvenience, but by increaſing the ſale thereof (that is by increaſing <hi>Trade</hi>) conſequently, nothing can be alleaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aforeſaid meanes, for inriching a poore people, but what argues as ſtrongly againſt an encreaſe of <hi>Trade</hi> amongſt them, though it be at preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dead; which was the thing here to be evinced.</p>
               <p>And for a further proof of this; though if I ſhould ſay, that when trade is once decayed in any place, there is no means to quicken it, but by an encreaſe of mony not hoarded up, I ſhould not only deny the truth it ſelfe, but the validity of that other meanes, which this
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> by the whole ſcope thereof, is deſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; yet when it ſhall be ſeaſonable to diſcover what this other meanes is, I ſhall then manifeſtly prove, that without an encreaſe of money (not hoarded up) or the uſe of this or ſuch like meanes, it cannot be expected; that when trade is once decayed in any place, it ſhould poſſibly be quickned &amp; revived: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an objection againſt the uſe of that meanes, without which this or that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe at all can be effected, doth by conſequence argue, as ſtrongly againſt the enterpriſe it ſelfe; that which was here to be proved (needleſſe any more to be repeated) doth follow.</p>

               <p>And although, happily upon this ground, it may be conceived by ſome, that there needeth not any more time nor labour to be ſpent, in the further proofe of this point; yet becauſe upon the ſerious diſcuſſing thereof, many things very material will appear, which muſt have been ſomewhere ſuggeſted; it will be neceſſary for thoſe, that would fully underſtand the ſcope of this Treatiſe, to take cogniſance thereof, before they proceed any further.</p>
               <p>As that (therefore) is a <hi>quick Trade,</hi> which by a reaſonable profit in the pound, doth more then maintain the charge of the Tradeſmen; ſo that is a <hi>dead Trade,</hi> which by the ſame profit will not ſerve to maintain that charge; whence it neceſſarily followes, that if
<hi>Trade</hi> amongſt any people be dead, ſuch a people without an extraordinary profit in the pound, being forced to ſpend every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſomething out of the main ſtock, are, (as I have already more fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ſo far from being in a way of thriving, as till Trade be made quicker, they muſt (of neceſſity) grow every year poorer then formerly, even untill they be reduced, to the outmoſt extremity of want.</p>
               <p>And if to remedy this, the <hi>Whole-ſale-man, Retayler,</hi> and all others that are to have allowance, out of the price of any Commodity, do take an extraordinary profit in the pound; to the end, that ſuch their profit, may ſomething help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſlowneſs of their returnes; they make all ſorts of Commodities ſo dear (as according to what is proved in the
<hi>Section</hi> following) it coſt's them (near, if not altogether) as much extraordinary charge, to maintain their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as ſuch increaſe of profit, which by this meanes they advance, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to: Whereby, ſtill they come (neare, if not altogether) as far ſhort of being able, to maintain a Family Charge by a dead Trade, without ſpending out of the main ſtock, as if none of them had raiſed the price of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities at all.</p>
               <p>From all this it is evident, that there is no objection can hold, againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Trade it ſelf, if it be at preſent dead; but what argues as much, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inriching alone, but the meer preſerving of a poor people, from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees, into the extreameſt want and beggery; whereby alſo for want of meanes to defend themſelves, they are made lyable to be inſlaved by other Nations.</p>
               <p>Now, conſidering that amongſt earthly evills, incident to any Nation, theſe two are the worſt that can be imagined, (ſo as there being nothing fully to counterpoſe theſe inconveniencies,) it followes, that nothing can be materially objected, againſt an increaſe of Trade amongſt any people, if it be at preſent dead, which was the thing here to be proved.</p>
               <p>Yet further, ſeeing it is manifeſt, that nothing can with any colour be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, againſt an increaſe of Trade amongſt any people, except this, that it may tend to increaſe the price of their Commodities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170618:17"/>To this I anſwer, that if it were ſo, that encreaſe of Trade, did neceſſarily occaſion an encreaſe in the price of commodities, yet the Inconvenience
[eſpecially to thoſe whoſe Trade is at preſent, in a declining condition] would not countervail the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; Seeing, that for a people [whoſe Eſtates through the deadneſſe of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, doth daily decline] to have their riches increaſed, though the price of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, ſhould alſo thereby increaſe, is a greater advantage then though
<hi>commodity</hi> ſhould be never ſo <hi>cheap,</hi> to have their eſtates in the mean time to <hi>waſt</hi> and <hi>decay;</hi> the rather, for that an increaſe of Trade, doth occaſion an encreaſe in the current of commodity, whereby a greater quantity thereof being [as is already proved] diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt men, for their more comfortable ſubſiſtence; in this caſe, if <hi>plenty of</hi> commodity [which is the effect of a quick trade] were not conſiſtent with

               <p>Laſtly, and chiefly, it is to be obſerved, that in any place where both Inteſtine and Forreigne commodity enough, is to be had for money, an encreaſe of Trade doth not at all occaſion an encreaſe in the price of ſuch commodity: For though <hi>trade</hi> in any place do increaſe never ſo faſt, yet tradeſmen cannot make the price of commodity to riſe, except [trading not being now ſo dead, as whereby to diſcourage men from bringing in much ware] they can order matters ſo, as it may not be brought in faſt enough, to ſupply the preſent
<hi>Market;</hi> for otherwiſe, if one Tradeſman will not ſell his commodity at a reaſonable rate, another [glad of the opportunity] would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly furniſh the
<hi>Market;</hi> and [to make his returnes the quicker] ſell it as cheap as he can afford, that is [as I ſhall prove in the next Section] nuch cheaper, then in caſe trading were dead, he could.</p>
               <p>Hence, as there is a quicker Trade in <hi>London,</hi> then in any other City in

               <p>And there is no doubt, but that if any <hi>Nation</hi> (through the abundant expences of the people, by means of their riches) do become unto the reſt of the world, as <hi>London</hi> is to
<hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Chief Seat</hi> of Trade, the reaſon for bringing in commodity to that place, more then to any other part of the world, is the ſame, for that of bringing in more commodity to <hi>London,</hi> then to any other place in <hi>England;</hi> Becauſe, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any Land, there is but ſale for commodity, before there ſhould want commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in that place to ſupply the <hi>Market,</hi> as faſt as need requires, all the Merchants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting here on earth, would chearfully entertain the opportunity, to poſt it thither in great proportions, whereby (I ſay) the dearneſſe of ſuch commodity in that place, would be prevented, ſo as there remaining no other imaginable ſcruple, againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Trade, I conclude, that the thing to be diſcovered in this place, doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appear, <hi>viz.</hi> How the aforeſaid means for inriching a poor peeple, is fully cleared, from all ſcruples and objections.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y what hath been already ſaid, (which yet in the concluſion to this Section, ſhall be more fully cleared) it doth appear, that where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity enough is to be had for money, men are forced to ſell the ſame at as low a rate, (I mean as ſmall a profit in the pound) as with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the quickneſſe of their returns they can afford; ſo as the main Queſtion is; Whether if Trade be extraordinary quick, (Commodities being ſold as cheap as they can well be afforded) they will not thereby fall to a far lower rate, and yet tradeſmen gain much more
<hi>per annum</hi> then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>In order to the ſolution of which doubt, let it be conſidered, that if when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extreme deadneſſe of trading, the Whole-ſale-man cannot live, in caſe he have not 2. s. 6. d. per l. profit, upon each return, he of whom the Whole-ſale-man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his ware, nor yet the Retayler to whom he ſells it, under 5. s. each; that is in all 12. s. 6. d. amongſt them all three.</p>
               <p>Yet if their Trade were ten times as quick, they might all gain twice as much in the year, upon the fiſt part of that profit, that is, upon 2. s. 6. d. in the pound amongſt them, which coming ſhort of 12. s. 6. d. by ten ſhillings, commodities might hereby be afforded at ten ſhillings in the pound, (that is, one half part) cheaper then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>But beſides, if trading be (ſuppoſe) ten times as quick as formerly, and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commodities of all ſorts, ſhould be ſold at half the rate as formerly; Tradeſmen in this caſe, would not only gain twice as much <hi>per annum,</hi> but out of that doubled profit maintain their Families, at half that rate as formerly; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, might ſtill afford to ſell their commodities at a far leſſe profit, which leſſe profit of all the ſeverall ſorts of tradeſmen put together, (as before is obſerved) would make commodities, yet conſiderably cheaper, ſo as men might maintain their families ſtill at leſſe charge, conſequently live by the leſſe profit; and ſo untill that which cannot now be afforded under twenty ſhillings, might be ſold at twelve pence.</p>
               <p>And further, we have here onely reckoned the price of commodities as they might be afforded, by abating the profit only of three ſeverall ſorts of Tradeſmen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and that but in the half of the proportion, as is correſpondent to the quickneſſe of their trading, and we find it very conſiderable: But for Merchants, or ſuch as traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with other Nations, it is to be obſerved, that they buy their ware of thoſe Tradeſmen, who uſually procure it of ſuch handicrafts men, as make it fit for ſale; who have their materialls poſſibly of the Farmers, or ſome other waies out of the cattell or fruits of the earth; ſo as each commodity goeth through two or three hands, before it come to the Merchant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170618:18"/>Again, the Merchant having exchanged it beyond Sea, for ſome forreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, uſually ſells the ſame to the Whole-ſale-man, or at leaſt to a Shop-keeper in ſome chief City, that many times ſells it (or the moſt part of it) to the Countrey Mercer, or ſome other retailing tradeſmen; and they in great part to the Pedler, before it be ſold out to each one, for his private uſe.</p>
               <p>Now, if we take out of the price of forreign commodities ⅘ parts of the profit of all thoſe Tradeſmen that prepare domeſtick commodities for the Merchant, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ⅘ parts of the profit, that the Merchant doth gain by exchange of domeſtick for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne commodities; and ⅘ parts of the profit of all thoſe tradeſmen that hand this forreigne commodity from one to another, untill it be ſold to each man for his private uſe; aſſuredly the commodity it ſelf might in this caſe, be afforded for little more then a fifth part of what otherwiſe it could; and yet (men having now one with another, ten times more trading then formerly) gain twice as much <hi>per annum</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and as hereby they get double to what they did formerly, ſo they might maintain their charge, at neer the fifth part of the rate as formerly; whereby the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid doubt is fully reſolved.</p>
               <p>And to illuſtrate this yet more clearly, Seeing the worth of all commodities muſt needs conſiſt, either in the principall and originall value thereof, or in the profit of thoſe that have to do therein, or in both; and conſidering that (as will appear to him; who ſhall duely weigh the ſame) there is no principall value in any commodity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the profit of every one that hath to do therein, (I mean the profit of the Whole-ſale-man, Retailer, Artificer, Farmer, Landlord, and ſuch like) it muſt needs follow, that if you make the profit of every one that hath to do therein, only the fifth part as formerly, you make the commodity it ſelf to be worth, but the fifth part, as formerly.</p>
               <p>Now as this is moſt evident, that if every one who is to have an allowance out of the price of any commodity, takes but a fifth part of the profit as formerly, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity it ſelf will thereby be afforded at a fifth part of the rate as formerly; And this alſo is clear, that if tradeſmen ſell ten times as much in the year as formerly, they gain twice as much <hi>per annum,</hi> by the fifth part of that profit upon each commodity, as if otherwiſe they had ſold, for full five times as great a profit: So this alſo is manifeſt, that if men gain twice as much <hi>per annum,</hi> as when formerly commodity was five times dearer; they may now maintain their charge, upon the tenth part of that yearly profit, as well as before upon the whole profit.</p>
               <p>So as though in this caſe, they ſhould afford Commodity at the fifth part of the rate as formerly, yet the Landlord for his Rent, and all others that are to have any allowance, out of the price of any commodity, taking but a fifth part of the rate as formerly; their advantage by maintaining their Families ſo much the cheaper, would be the ſame as if they had full five times as great a profit.</p>
               <p>Yet, if in this caſe, the Landlord ſhould have the ſame rent as formerly, as his own advantage would be, that it would go in houſe-keeping five times as far as formerly; ſo the price of commodities in reference to the allowance of rent alone, would not be much the dearer thereby.</p>
               <p>Although in truth, the Landlord, in this caſe will not eaſily prevail upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to value his land, at a higher rate, then the preſent worth of the commodities it yeilds, for that if commodities be now worth but the fifth part as formerly, it is clear that he who paies as much rent as formerly, will not in this caſe be able to make ſo much money of the fruits of ſuch Land, as the rent thereof doth amount to.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, it follows, that (at leaſt) if matters could be ordered ſo, as by quicking of Trade both the value of mens rents, and profit of mens trades, could be made to fall by degrees, every day more then other, thoſe things which now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170618:19"/>not be afforded under 20. s. might at laſt be ſold at 12. d. and yet no perſon prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby, for that each man (being hereby able to maintain his charge at the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of that rate as formerly) might now as well live upon the twentieth part of that profit as before upon the whole profit: And as the Landlord would receive no prejudice, by ſuch fall in the value of his Rents, in regard, that the price of all other things do hereby fall proportionably, ſo the Tradeſman would notwithſtanding, be by this means a gainer more then formerly, in full as great a meaſure as trade ſhould hereby be increaſed, above what it was formerly; From all which in anſwer to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid doubt, it follows, that where Trade is extraordinary quick, commodities may be afforded at much leſſe rate, and yet Tradeſmen gain much more <hi>per annum</hi> then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
               <p>Now, that in this caſe commodities ſhall be ſold at as low a rate, as they can well be afforded, will appear from hence, That as when trade in any place is very dead, the Merchant is carefull not to bring in any commodity, which [as far as he can probably foreſee] will not go off at ſuch a rate, as may ſomething anſwer the charge of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, the skill of a trade, and hazard of a ſtock, which [in caſe returns be very ſlow, ſeeing an ordinary profit will not countervail] if he doth not apprehend ſome hopes of a greater profit, he doth forbear to bring in any conſiderable quantity of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, till it be grown ſo ſcarce as (the price thereof riſen) his profit may become at leaſt a means of neceſſary incouragement.</p>
               <p>Hereby it followes, that as Tradeſmen cannot afford to live, at neer ſo little profit in the pound, when trade is dead as otherwiſe; ſo they make a ſhift by degrees, through their forbearing to bring in a competency thereof, to raiſe the price of each commodity in ſome meaſure correſpondent; Though by making them pay ſo much the dearer, towards the maintinance of their Families; the inconvenience is [I ſay] al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, [if not altogether] as bad as the advantage.</p>
               <p>So contrarily, where trade is extraordinary quick, men are incouraged to bring in the utmoſt that the Market will take off, though the price thereof do fall thereby: For, that if through the quickneſſe of their Returns, they can have but ſuch a profit in the pound, as whereby to make (yearly) ſome conſiderable increaſe of their Stock (beſides the defraying of their family charge) it comes all to one effect, whether their profit in the pound be greater or leſſe.</p>
               <p>So as hereby, every one ſtriving (I ſay) to take the moſt money, ſuch as will not ſell at a reaſonable rate, muſt keep their commodities upon their hands, whereby not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities (I ſay) fall in price, but men ſave almoſt, if not altogether as much (in the maintenance of their charge) as they ſeem to loſe by the abatement of their profit in the pound.</p>
               <p>From all which, it may be concluded, that where commodity enough is to be had for money, quickneſſe of trading doth occaſion a conſiderable fall in the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was the thing to be proved.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Bſerving that it is no unuſual thing, for men to give a more upright and impartiall ſentence in matters, which are in ſuch ſort propounded, under ſome figurative and
<hi>parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi> ſenſe, as they diſcerne not to what particular caſes, ſuch their ſentence may be applyed to the unexpected convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, by their own agreement, unto things which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would never have conſented to.</p>
               <p>That many things are of ſuch a nature, as they cannot ſo eaſily be <hi>obviated</hi> and
<hi>illuſtrated,</hi> to the underſtandings of thoſe who have not bin exerciſed therein, as by ſome familiar ſimilitude, taken from examples, with which through frequent experience, they are well acquainted.</p>
               <p>And that according to the Rules dictated by thoſe, who have made it their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, to propoſe the moſt clear and compendious Method of <hi>Argumentation;</hi> the <hi>Major propoſition</hi> of a <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a conſequence or inference doth naturally follow, from a thing onely ſuppoſed,) is before the ſuppoſition it ſelf to be demonſtrated; which order of proceeding hath the ſame ground in reaſon, when ſomething inſtead of ſuch ſuppoſition, will appear fully to make out the ſame effect and conſequence.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſome other reſpects, I concluded, that to diſcover the nature of the intended enterpriſe, for increaſe of Wealth by improving of Trade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Title (in the moſt plain brief, and effectual method that I could deviſe) there would be a neceſſity (before the propoſal of the matter it ſelf,) to repreſent (by way of parable or ſuppoſition) ſome caſe, that (being as near as poſſible, parallel to it, in reference both to the inconveniences and advantages following thereupon,) I might (thus in a myſtery) prevent all material objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before I came to the plain diſcovery of the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall give you the ſum of all, in few words.</p>
               <p>Admit <hi>a certain</hi> MYNE <hi>of</hi> GOLD <hi>diſcovered in this Land, were wholly reſigned up to the diſpoſe of ſuch men, as ſhould become ingaged by Bond to reſtore within ſix Moneths warning, both the uſe and poſſeſſion of the ſaid</hi> MYNE:
<hi>together, with ſo much of the ſaid</hi> GOLD, <hi>as ſhould be coyned, or any wayes diſpoſed of:</hi> And (I ſay) that this would incur more inconveniences, and yet not afford greater advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, (to thoſe that ſhould have the diſpoſing thereof, or to any other perſons) then what would follow, upon the enterprize hereafter propoſed, as by what doth enſue will appear: In the mean time I proceed to repreſent ſomething of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170618:20"/>the nature of this undertaking, by an explication of my meaning, in the words before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A certain Myne of Gold,</hi> That is metall of ſuch real worth, as will yield (with little or no loſſe) the money, if it ſhould be ſold to the Goldſmith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Myne,</hi> That is not a Treaſury which may ſoone be exhauſted, but which may afford ſuch a quantity of money, as whereby the ſame may upon occaſion be multiplyed to any proportion needfull.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>a Myne,</hi> For this being not money ready <hi>coyned,</hi> requires ſome charge of defending, digging, coyning, and ſuch like; yet as the charge of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, ſhall not be near ſo great, as that which is incident to the ordering of a Myne of Gold, ſo I ſhall ſhew how the ſaid Company, may be wholly eaſed of this Charge, without prejudice to any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this Land,</hi> I confeſs (as I have already intimated,) the diſcovery of a Myne of Gold <hi>in this Land,</hi> could not chuſe but be a great provocation to all Nations, to conſpire together againſt this people, for the ſurprizing of it, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them in caſe they ſhould, to maintain ſufficient forces, whereby for ever to inſlave us, as the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> doth thoſe, whom they call <hi>Nicrolians</hi> or <hi>Natives</hi> in
<hi>America;</hi> But (as is ſaid) this enterpriſe ſhall not incur the leaſt appearance of any ſuch inconvenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were wholly reſigned up to the diſpoſe of ſuch Tradeſmen,</hi> That is, ſo as whereby they might not onely be able to multiply money enough amongſt them, for the increaſing of their Trade and riches; but likewiſe to lend of the ſame, upon the tearmes hereafter expreſſed, each to other, as much as neede requires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any <hi>Intereſt:</hi> which will be the more ſeaſonable, for that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Trade, (through ſuch a multiplication of money amongſt them) they will have ſo much the more need to increaſe their ſtock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of ſuch Tradeſmen as ſhould become ingaged by Bond,</hi> That is, as <hi>Sureties</hi> each for other; ſo as if any one failes to reſtore the proportion by him borrowed, the reſt muſt make it good; And therefore it muſt be ſuppoſed, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes take ſufficient ſecurity, each from other, for what is ſo lent unto any of them.</p>
               <p>To which end, let it be admitted, that they (I meane the whole number or company of them, this Myne not being at the diſpoſe of any one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt) do lend of the ſaid money being coyned, unto any one perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, no more then for borrowing of which he ſhall put in ſufficient ſecurity, (by producing Sureties, Morgaging Lands, or (if the company pleaſe to accept thereof) pawning Commodity of valuable conſideration,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay within five Moneths after the demanding thereof: And do likewiſe renew ſuch ſecurity as often as neede ſhall require, for as long time as he intends to borrow of the ſaid money: And alſo that he ſtand bound with the reſt of the Company, for making good his proportion towards either the loſſe (in caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt them faile to repay what is by him borrowed) or any charge inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this undertaking, if need require.</p>
               <p>Yet to prevent ſuch <hi>Fayler</hi> each perſon beſides his ſecurity,) which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (no doubt) will in this caſe take care ſhall be very ſufficient) produce an Enſurer, (ſuch as the Company ſhall accept of) who for ſome ſmall matter, in the pound, (to be paid by him that borrowes the money) will inſure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany againſt any prejudice, that can happen to them by the loane of the ſaid money, upon ſuch ſecurity: Whereby it may come to paſſe, that in caſe not onely any one who borrowes this money, but his
<hi>Sureties</hi> (though judged very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170618:20"/>ſufficient) ſhould faile of being able to make good the debt; yet ſuch
<hi>Inſurers</hi> bearing the loſſe, the Company may for this ſmall charge in the pound, be freed from hazard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſtore within ſix Moneths,</hi> That is, what they have ſo borrowed, but not any Intereſt, or any part of their profit, though never ſo much, and for never ſo long a time.</p>
               <p>And though I ſpeak here of <hi>Reſtoring,</hi> yet it is to be obſerved (in reference to the caſe, which I ſhall propoſe; that as there will be no advantage (I ſay) to an enemy to ſurpriſe this Treaſure, ſo there will be no benefit, but rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the owners (if any were) to have it <hi>Reſtored:</hi> ſo as it is not at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that any ſuch thing will ever be required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both the uſe and poſſeſſion of the ſaid Myne, together with ſo much of the ſaid Gold as ſhould be any wayes diſpoſed of;</hi> That is, this Company muſt make good, not onely the money lent each to other, but all the Gold (whether coyned or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,) that ſhall be <hi>imbezzelled,</hi> if they uſe not ſome effectual meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame.</p>
               <p>To which end, let it be granted, (for how much ſoever ſeemingly impoſſible, it ſhal be fully made good,) that there were a way found, whereby not any dram of this gold, whether coyned or uncoyned, could poſſibly be diſpoſed of, to any though imployed in or about digging, defending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Myne, coyning the money, or howſoever, otherwiſe, then by the conſent and expreſſe order of the ſaid Company, without being preſently diſcovered.</p>
               <p>And for defraying the Charges of this undertaking, let the ſaid Company cauſe ſuch a conſiderable quantity of Gold to be coyn'd, as wherewith to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſo much Land, as the rent thereof may fully defray the ſaid charges, which charge, in regard (I ſay) it will not be near ſo great, as that of digging, defending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Myne, and yet the Treaſure as great as need can require, may the more eaſily be done.</p>
               <p>And for ſecuring them in their thus diſpoſing of the ſaid money, the Land ſo purchaſed being in the poſſeſſion of the ſaid Company, will be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Thus, (ſeeing by what hath been already diſcovered, it is evident, that Trade and riches through an increaſe of money, may be multiplyed to the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree poſſible; and that by meanes of ſuch a Myne, money might be augmented to any quantity needfull thereunto) I have in a Parable, repreſented the nature of the intended enterprize, for increaſe of wealth, by improving of Trade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Title, which was the thing in this place to be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Yet, leaſt by what is here ſuggeſted, I might ſeem to beſtow my paines in building Caſtles (as they ſay) in the Aire or upon the ſand, where there is no foundation, and not to be indeed in good earneſt, I ſhall before I come to the end of this ſecond Book, make it appear, that what is here repreſented in every particular, (though ſeemingly never ſo impoſſible or impertinent) will prove no other then like to that Parable of <hi>Nathan,</hi> neerer <hi>Davids</hi> own caſe then he was aware of; and therefore deſire, that every clauſe in this Section may be the more carefully obſerved.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Shewing, <hi>How</hi> inconſiderable <hi>the</hi> diſadvantages <hi>incident to this undertaking are.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the aforeſaid Parable, repreſented the true nature of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended enterpriſe, and thereby given a brief touch, as well of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences</hi> as <hi>Advantages</hi> following thereupon, it will be needful in the next place, that both of them be ſeriouſly conſidered; In handling of which, I ſhall begin, firſt with the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> or
<hi>diſadvantages,</hi> which, if we take in order, as they are expreſſed in the former Section, it will be found, that the firſt particular, (which doth but ſeem like an
<hi>Inconvenience</hi>) is that of the charge incident to <hi>defending, digging, coyning,</hi> and ſuch like; yet ſeeing that this charge, (yea, and for a need much more then this) may be wholly defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rent of the Lands purchaſed with the money ſo coyned, it follows, that this ſuppoſed <hi>diſadvantage</hi> amounts to juſt <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſeeming <hi>diſadvantage</hi> doth conſiſt, in that the ſaid <hi>Myne of gold,</hi> is Situate in this Land; yet (in a word) it being of ſuch a nature as it is no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to ſuch as ſhould ſurpriſe it, this is alſo no <hi>diſadvantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third (and indeed, only) <hi>Inconvenience</hi> is, that thoſe who undertake the diſpoſe of this <hi>Myne,</hi> muſt be engaged by <hi>Bond,</hi> as <hi>Sureties</hi> each for other, to make good what they borrow thereof, in manner aforeſaid: Which implies firſt ſome hazzard, becauſe if any of them fail, the reſt when the ſurrendring of the ſaid Mine is required, muſt make it good. Secondly ſome difficulty, for that each member muſt produce ſecurity to the company for repayment, both of what is by him borrowed, and his proportion alſo towards the charge and loſs, incident to this undertaking, (if any be) which ſecurity to procure may not be very eaſy to all men: And therefore (it may be remembred, that) in the
<hi>Title page</hi> ſome both <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>hazzard,</hi> is acknowledged to be incident to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; yet (I ſay) when all things ſhall be duly pondered, neither the one nor the other, will be found conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, not the <hi>hazzard:</hi> For though (I confeſs of all others, this comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the nature of a <hi>diſadvantage;</hi> Yet I am confident, it will be granted, that it is not valuable, eſpecially, if compared with thoſe deſirable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that will follow upon this <hi>Engagement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this <hi>hazzard,</hi> is no other then that which it is well known, the ſeveral Companies in <hi>London,</hi> do frequently undergo, by lending out their moneys to young beginners, meerely to do them a courteſie.</p>
               <p>And if the Company, that ſhall undertake the diſpoſe of this Mine, be careful that they accept of no ſecurity each from other, but what ſhall appear very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the
<hi>hazzard</hi> will not be ſo great as that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> men uſually incur, by letting out moneys to intereſt; for in this caſe, if both the Principal and Sureties fail, the <hi>Lender</hi> (that is uſually one man alone) muſt bear all the loſs; Whereas, when money is lent out by a whole Company, if one in two or three hundred fail, (the loſs being borne by all the whole Company proportionably) each mans ſhare will not be much conſiderable; For that, as it is accounted a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170618:21"/>hazard, for a Marchant to adventure his whole Eſtate as Sea, in one Bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om, rather then in many: So there is the ſame reaſon for like difference of hazard betwixt the lending of money by any one perſon, over what the lending thereof would be by a whole Company.</p>
               <p>Yet, as thoſe that let out moneys to Intereſt, do not uſually truſt any, without taking ſuch ſecurity as they (at leaſt) Judge very ſufficient; (whereby it comes to paſs, that there is not one caſe in very many, wherein both Principal and Sureties fail, of being able to pay the Debt;) So, if they did not conceive their Security ſufficient, and if out of the profit of their Intereſt they could afford to <hi>Inſure</hi> againſt hazards, as thoſe of this Engagement, (not taking any Security, but ſuch as (if they pleaſe) not onely one Inſurer, but a certain Company of them ſhall approve of;) may for leſs (I beleeve if they think it needful) then one in the hundred <hi>per annum.</hi> In this caſe, though perhaps one amongſt two or three hundred, might poſſibly fail both in himſelf and <hi>Sureties;</hi> yet this Company of
<hi>Inſurers,</hi> muſt make good the debt.</p>
               <p>Whereby, ſeeing that ſuch <hi>Inſurers</hi> would (as they do by Inſuring of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants adventures upon the Sea,) get one time with another more then they looſe, it follows, that what is thus paid to the <hi>Inſurers,</hi> would of it ſelf more then defray the loſſes, incident to this kind of hazard; which (I ſay) by the rent of the Land purchaſed in manner aforeſaid, might be fully diſcharged, ſo as, this which is indeed the main and only
<hi>Inconvenience,</hi> being duly weighed, amounts but to a very inconſiderable <hi>Charge,</hi> and that alſo defrayed <hi>without Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, ſeeing that if men put their moneys out to Intereſt, the hazard is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that which is incident to this undertaking.</p>
               <p>That if they imploy it in a way of Trade, as the profit in good times, ſo the hazard at all times, is much greater, then that of putting out moneys to intereſt, as is found true by experience, and acknowledged by all.</p>
               <p>That if they purchaſe Land, (conſidering as the profit of rent is ſo ſmall, as it requires a great Stock to obtain ſo much, as will afford a maintenance, ſo) an Eſtate in Land, if an enemy prevaile, is more liable to ſurptizal or ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in any moveables.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that beſides one of theſe three, there is no other way, whereby men can ordinarily diſpoſe of their monies; It follows, that (except men could ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally afford to keep their ſtock by them in money, without Improving it, and ſo by ſpending out of the
<hi>Principal,</hi> run wilfully upon ſpeedy and certain ruin, for fear of incurring hazards, and loſſes ſome other way,) there is no poſſible means whereby they can diſpoſe of their Eſtates, to be totally free, whilſt they live in this World from all danger of loſſes.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that notwithſtanding there is (as I have already proved) greater hazard in letting out moneys to Intereſt, then in this undertaking, though (I ſay) the hazard of that (amongſt all other means hitherto uſed for improving mens Stocks, is one of the leaſt) there are ſo many thouſands, who not valuing the hazard, in reference to the advantage daily practice this courſe, in hopes but of a ſmall profit of Intereſt, and by that ſmall profit, do one time with another, gain more then they looſe by ſuch hazard, as is evident, by mens continuing this practice.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, it muſt needs be granted, that though this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king were liable to far more hazard then that which may be Inſured, or the loſs thereof ſuſtained, for leſs then one in the hundred, yet in regard it will appear that the profit of this
<hi>undertaking,</hi> will be far greater then that of the ordinary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170618:22"/>way of Trade;) and eſpecially in reſpect that this charge of Inſurance, may be defrayed without any burden to the Company, it follows that ſuch hazard,) though it were more then it is, is in this caſe not worthy to be accounted a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,</hi> to thoſe (who take what courſe they will,) cannot avoid greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; except (I ſay) by keeping their moneys in their own hands, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, in hopes to eſcape ſome fears of loſs, to incur unavoidable ruin, rather then ingage in a courſe, which (though liable to ſo little Inconvenience) will (as I ſhall prove) afford far greater profit, then any that otherwiſe the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, can expect to injoy.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the danger of the times makes the hazard conſiderable; I anſwer, this argues as ſtrongly againſt mens diſpoſing of their ſtocks, in a way of Trade, or any other way of improving their eſtates; whereby (as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved,) through the prevailing of an enemy, they may the more eaſily be ſurpriſed: ſo as although this danger of an enemies prevailing, were far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then (through the goodneſs of God) it is at preſent: yet ſeeing men could not afford generally, to forbear all Trade and Commerce, thoſe that account of theſe conſiderations as valuable, may chooſe whether they will meddle in this undertaking; For there is no queſtion, but the generality of men, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convinced that thoſe, who forbearing to imploy their <hi>Stock</hi> ſpend out of the <hi>Principal,</hi> do run a far more apparent hazard of utter undoing, then they who in fear of an enemies prevailing (though no man knows when or how) would endeavour to avoid, as is evident by the practice of moſt men; in that they continue ſtill in ſome meaſure, not only to Trade, but purchaſe Land; lend and borrow monies upon Intereſt, and ſuch like, as it is ſaid in another caſe, men will ſtill do, until the conſummation of all terreſtrial things.</p>
               <p>Thus much as to the <hi>hazard;</hi> Secondly, for the <hi>difficulty,</hi> this being no other, then of procuring good and ſufficient ſecurity, for the due payment of what is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, is no more then that, which is required by the ſeveral Companies of <hi>London,</hi> when they proffer (as is ſaid) to lend moneys to any young beginners, or others of their own Company; And yet few men having ſuch a proffer made them, (eſteeming the uſe of the money no ſmall advantage) but will make hard ſhift, to procure friends one where or other to be bound for them (though they have perhaps little eſtate of their own,) rather then they will loſe the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch a proffer; but to thoſe who have great Eſtates, this is no difficulty at all.</p>
               <p>And to clear all ſcruples, ſeeing that notwithſtanding the preſent, not only danger of the times, but deadnes of trading, divers men ſtill continue this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of taking up monies upon Intereſt, to imploy in a way of Trade, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how could ſuch as let it out find any to deal with them:</p>
               <p>That by this means trading (as I shall prove) will be ſo multiplyed eſpecially to the Undertakers) as they ſhall have much more reaſon to imploy the utmoſt of their Stock and credit, in a way of Trade, then now they have.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that neither the hazard of lending, nor the difficulty of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that money, which is thus lent without Intereſt, is any greater, then that of borrowing money upon Intereſt. There is no objection can poſſibly beat any colour againſt the one, which doth not argue far more ſtrongly againſt the other.</p>
               <p>And further, let it not here be forgotten, that though the procuring of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſecurity, for the borrowing of any conſiderable ſums of money, may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170618:22"/>too hard a task for the poorer ſort of Tradeſmen to perform; yet there will be nothing required of them, in order to the putting themſelves into a capacity of multiplying their trading, and that with ready pay (as is in the Title Page men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) which hath any, either hazard or difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>The next and laſt thing (which ſeems like an inconvenience,) is, that this Company are bound to make good, not only the money lent, but the Gold, (whether coyned or otherwiſe) that ſhall be <hi>Imbezzelled;</hi> yet having taken it upon my credit, to diſcover a way, how this danger may be totally prevented; ſo as upon this, there will follow no <hi>inconvenience</hi> at all. I may conclude, that all things duly weighed, the <hi>diſadvantages</hi> incident to this undertaking, are not conſiderable; which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>

                  <p> Shewing, How one of the <hi>leaſt</hi> of the <hi>Advantages,</hi> proceeding from the intended enterpriſe, doth much <hi>more then countervaile all</hi> the ſaid
<hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the laſt Section fully and freely declared, the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences incident to this undertaking, with all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, whereby (as I conceive) it may appear to all rational men, that the ſame are not valuable; though the profit of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe were but ordinary; how much leſs conſiderable will thoſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be, when it ſhall be found, <hi>that one of the leaſt Advantages proceeding from the intended enterpriſe, doth much more then countervaile all the ſaid diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;</hi> which is the thing that in this laſt place, I am to diſcover.</p>
               <p>Now, as there is nothing can be named, which is eſſential to a thriving Trade, but one of theſe four, <hi>viz.</hi> Competent Stock, quick return, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profit, and ready pay, or good ſecurity; (all which by means of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking will be obtained in a plentiful meaſure;) So the firſt of theſe four (though not equal to any of the other,) will be found of value, much more then ſufficient to Counter-poyſe all the ſaid Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>For the ſaid Myne of Gold, affording money enough whereby men may borrow without paying Intereſt, as great a ſum, and for as long a time, as they ſhall put in ſufficient ſecurity to make good, they may thereby increaſe their Stock, two manner of wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170618:23"/>Firſt, By having ſo much of that money lent them at preſent, as they are able to put in ſufficient ſecurity, in manner aforeſaid to borrow; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſeeing according to mens credit (which is eſteemed equal to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates) ſuch is their ability for procuring Sureties, it will be no difficult thing for men ordinarily to produce ſuch ſecurity, as whereby at leaſt to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Stocks, and perhaps much more; which was my meaning in the Title Page.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is, that if by trading with this doubled Stock, any one of this Company doth encreaſe his eſtate, he may upon like ſecurity have ſo much more lent him, as whereby to double ſuch encreaſe.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of this, is very great, as may appear by this inſtance; Suppoſe a man be worth in Land one thouſand pounds, and Morgaging that Land borrows one thouſand pounds to follow a Trade, if from hence through ſuch great trading, as muſt neceſſarily follow upon this courſe, he do at the end of one twelve-moneths, gain clear two hundred pounds, (which gain is much within the compaſs, of what in reſpect of the ſaid quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of trading, we might reckon upon) that two hundred pounds ſo gained, ſhall be his own; and ſo (ſuppoſing that the profit of his Land hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his family,) he is now worth in all one thouſand two hundred pounds, (beſides the one thouſand pounds borrowed) therefore if now upon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in further ſecurity, he be truſted with two hundred pounds more, his Stock for Trade ſhall be one thouſand four hundred pounds, <hi>viz.</hi> One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred pounds borrowed, and two hundred pounds gained, by which Stock of one thouſand four hundred pounds, (his trading not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to decay.) he cannot gain leſs, then three hundred pounds, for the next year, whereby his eſtate is now worth three hundred pounds more, that is in all, one thouſand ſeven hundred pounds; And therefore be may now upon putting in further ſecurity, be truſted with three hundred pounds more, And ſo his Stock for Trade, will now at the end of two yeares, be no leſs then two thouſand pounds, that is juſt double to the Stock firſt lent him.</p>
               <p>So that by this means his Stock at the end of every two years, ſhall be double to what it was two years before, that is, at the end of four years, it ſhall be four thouſand pounds, at the end of ſix years, eight thouſand pounds, at the end of eight years ſixteen thouſand pounds, at the end of Ten years, thirty two thouſand pounds, at the end of twenty years (by the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of increaſe,) above one Million, and at the end of forty years, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one thouſand millions, the one half whereof only being borrowed, the other half is his proper Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And yet in this inſtance, we make no allowance (I ſay) at all for any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary quickneſs of trading, but that which makes the ſum ſo ſuddenly ariſe, to ſuch a vaſt and unexpected hight, is meerly the perpetual doubling of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his eſtate, by new money lent him without paying intereſt; which is not unlike unto that of doubling the number of
<hi>Buttons</hi> on a mans <hi>Suite,</hi> or <hi>Nails</hi> on a horſe <hi>Feet,</hi> where though you begin but with the worth of one Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corn, yet proceeding to double the value of every doubled ſum, according to the number of ſuch <hi>Buttons</hi> or <hi>Nails,</hi> it quickly amounts to a greater value, then the worth of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170618:23"/>If it be here objected, that except men (by the quickneſſe of their trading) can put off their commodities in ſome reaſonable time, it will be to their prejudice to trade with ſo exceeding great a ſtock?</p>
               <p>I anſwer in a word, that men being once rich enough, may (if they pleaſe) leave trading, and give place to others; yet if their trading ſhall be hereby multiplied, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proportionable to ſuch an increaſe of ſtock, few in this caſe will ſuddenly think their ſtock too great, which brings me to the ſecond Property eſſentiall to a thriving Trade, viz.
<hi>Quickneſſe of returns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order whereunto, it may be obſerved, that it followes by what I have already declared, (in Lib. 1. Sect. 4.) that where commodity enough is to be had for money, an increaſe of money not hoarded up, doth occaſion an increaſe of trade, and that much more then proportionable to ſuch increaſe of money; ſo as hereby men being in capacity to lend moneys each to other, till for a need the money that is amongſt them, be even equall to what their eſtates are otherwiſe worth, (that is, till there be about one hundred times more money amongſt them then ordinary) their trading by the revolution thereof, (that is, the <hi>quickneſse of their returnes</hi>) muſt needs be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, much above one hundred times greater then otherwiſe, if (I ſay) commodity enough can be got for money; or rather indeed, it is manifeſt, that by this meanes ſuch money not being hoarded up, they might multiply it by purchaſing of land, and lending the ſame gratis upon ſecurity, ſo as to improve trading to the utmoſt extent poſſible.</p>
               <p>Now by ſuch quickneſſe of returnes, mens yearly <hi>profit</hi> (which was the third thing eſſentiall to a thriving trade) muſt needs be increaſed in no ſmall meaſure, although their gaines in the pound, and conſequently the price of commodities in the mean time fall conſiderably, as is manifeſt by what is proved in Lib. 1. Sect. 7.</p>
               <p>Againe, when by the current of this multiplied ſtock of moneyes, their takings in ready pay are ſuch as makes their trade as great, as they can poſſibly manage, they may wholly refuſe to deale any more upon credit, and ſo injoy alſo the laſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage requiſite to a thriving trade, viz. <hi>ready pay, or good ſecurity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, all tradeſmen would rather be without a <hi>great ſtock</hi> then
<hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of trading, reaſonable profit,</hi> or <hi>good ſecurity:</hi> And that this interprize opens the door, not only to an increaſe of <hi>ſtock,</hi> but to ſo great a
<hi>multiplication of trading</hi> and yearly <hi>profit,</hi> and that with <hi>ready pay,</hi> it is evident to all underſtanding men, that this <hi>advantage</hi> of being in capacity to borrow as much money at any time, as men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put in ſecurity to make good without paying intereſt, is (though very great) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe other things leaſt of all conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Yet if it be obſerved, that the hazzard which men uſually undergo, when three or four in a company take up commodities upon truſt, (whereby each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ingaged for the reſt to pay the whole debt) or rather the aforeſaid hazzard of ſelling ware upon the particular credit of ſome one man, is a thing ſo ordinary, as it doth manifeſt, that notwithſtanding ſuch hazzard, and the allowance of intereſt in the price of their commodities, the advantages thereof are generally greater then the inconveniencies, as I ſhall have further occaſion to obſerve.</p>
               <p>That the hazzard of this undertaking, (beſides which there is no inconvenience worth the mentioning) may be inſured, for that which is not conſiderable to intereſt.</p>
               <p>That ſuch hazzard is much leſſe then that of putting out moneyes to intereſt, and therefore farre leſſe then what is incident to the ſaid ordinary way of trading on credit.</p>
               <p>That this new way of trading, puts men into a capacity of buying commodity (as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170618:24"/>with ready money) without allowing intereſt in the price thereof, which trading on credit doth not.</p>
               <p>All theſe things (I ſay) conſidered, it followes, that all the <hi>inconveniences</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this undertaking are ſo inconſiderable, to thoſe which proceed from any other way of Improvement, as that the aforeſaid <hi>one advantage of doubling the ſtock with the increaſe thereof,</hi> though put in the <hi>ballance</hi> againſt all the inconveniences incident to this attempt, will notwithſtanding be found to outweigh them an hundred fold.</p>
               <p>Therefore that which was here to be demonſtrated doth appeare, viz. <hi>That one of the leaſt advantages proceeding from the intended interpriſe, doth much more then counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile all the ſaid diſadvantages.</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>E foure things premiſed in the former <hi>Section,</hi> as eſſentiall to a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving trade, being all concluded as effects of this attempt; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found (by comparing one thing with another) that the leaſt of theſe foure doth much more then countervaile all the inconveniences incident to this <hi>enterprize,</hi> we are now to conſider <hi>what further means are requiſite to make this undertaking prove moſt effectuall, for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the aforeſaid properties eſſentiall to a thriving Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, whereas in the laſt Section it was alledged, that men were in capacity by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the aforeſaid Mine of gold at their diſpoſe, to lend moneys each to other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till for a need, there be a hundred times more money diſperſed amongſt them then was formerly; whereby their trading through the revolution thereof, (it not being hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up) muſt needs be multiplied more then proportionable to ſuch increaſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, according to what was proved, Lib. 1. Sect.
4.</p>
               <p>Againſt this it may be objected,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that perhaps as faſt as ſuch money ſhould increaſe by the loane of it to ſome, it would be hoarded up by its paſſing through the hands of others, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if
[which I hope God will prevent] new grounds of feare, in reference to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publike diſturbances ſhould ariſe; ſo as the current of this and all other money being obſtructed, by the hoarding of it up, this interprize for the increaſe of trade, would be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that happily the number of thoſe who will think fit to undertake the diſpoſe of this Mine, may be ſo few at firſt, as they ſhall not be able upon ſufficient ſecurity to borrow a ſum equall to the hundredth part of the value of all the moneyes that is already in the Land, whereby the quantity of money diſperſed amongſt Tradeſmen, will not be increaſed conſiderably, and conſequently the increaſe of Trade by ſo ſmall an increaſe of money, will be as little diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt acknowledge, that both theſe Objections do carry ſome force againſt what hath been as yet propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:170618:24"/>To remove therefore the bad effects of that which is ſuggeſted in each of theſe two caſes, let it be admitted, that the gold which this Mine doth afford being coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were firſt <hi>not at all acceptable to be hoarded up,</hi> though the times were never ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; Secondly, through ſome prejudice or miſapprehenſion of the generality of men,
<hi>were current at preſent onely amongſt a few.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then (I ſay) being true gold, that is, (according to what is already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<hi>mettall of ſuch reall value as</hi> (though not current with all, nor acceptable to be hoarded up by any) <hi>would yeeld the money it is taken for, without any conſiderable loſſe, if ſold to the Goldſmith;</hi> as in this caſe there could be no hazzard in taking it; ſo by the increaſe thereof, it would further trading much more then the increaſe of any money apt to be hoarded up would do, becauſe (as I have already ſufficiently cleared) it is the ſpeedy paſſage of moneyes from one to another, [without reſting any where] that quickens the revolution thereof, and by comſequence trading.</p>
               <p>If therefore matters can be ordered ſo, as this money ſhall not be at all acceptable to be hoarded up, it will ſerve not onely to anſwer fully the former of theſe two Objections, but to diſcover <hi>what further means is requiſite to make this undertaking prove effectuall, for the producing of all the Properties eſſentiall to a thriving trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in reference to the ſecond of the ſaid Objections, if this <hi>Company</hi> [and all thoſe that are willing of their owne accord to take this new kind of money, though not current by Law] ſhould agree to put out ſome <hi>flag, ſigne,</hi> or the like, whereby they might be diſtinguiſhed, and publikely knowne from others, it would follow, that thoſe who in this caſe ſhould be thus knowne for ſuch as are agreed to take it, as their hazzard [though they could not procure any to take it for ware] would not be conſiderable, in regard if they ſell it to the Goldſmith they may have ready money for it; ſo the advantage they ſhall reap by its being current onely amongſt a few, over what would accrew unto them in caſe the ſame were univerſally acceptable, [like other money] would be much greater then can eaſily be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>For, this money not being generally current, will by thoſe who [upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true value thereof] have accepted of the ſame for their ware or labour, be [for the moſt part] brought to ſuch men as are knowne by the aforeſaid <hi>flag</hi> or <hi>ſigne,</hi> whereby both their acquaintance and their takings in ready money, [that is, their trading] muſt needs be multiplied proportionable to the quantity, that is diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt them of this new kind of money; which, though laid out upon others never ſo often, will ſtill be retorted upon themſelves, [like ſtones caſt up in the aire by force, which will naturally returne towards their center; and conſequently, the more ſhall be thus throwne up, the more will come downe again,] ſo the more they have of this kind of money amongſt them, the more will their takings be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other ſide, if this new kind of money being once lent to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſhould [like other money] be diſperſed throughout the whole Nation indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, it would
[as to them] be little otherwiſe then as water ſpilt upon the ground, which returnes no more to the place from whence it came.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let it be ſuppoſed, that the quantity of this new kind of money, borrowed by the ſaid Company, were equall to the worth of their own eſtates, and that to the end they might multiply the ſame to a greater proportion, if need ſhould require, they had imployed as much of it in the purchaſe of Lands, as is equall to the value of the eſtates of all thoſe that [by hanging out the ſaid <hi>flag</hi> or <hi>ſigne</hi>] have made themſelves noted for ſuch as are agreed to take it; ſo as the ſum of this money [float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [I ſay] amongſt ſuch perſons chiefly, who have thus publiſhed themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take it] being hereby made equall [or if need require, far more then equall] to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170618:25"/>the Eſtates of all ſuch perſons (though never ſo many) it muſt needs multiply their <hi>takings</hi> in ready money in ſuch ſort, as trading might by this means be as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to <hi>them,</hi> as it would to the whole Land, in caſe any money generally current could be extended to the utmoſt quantity needfull.</p>
               <p>And hereby not only the laſt of the two aforeſaid Objections is fully anſwered, but a further means [diſcovered] requiſite to make this undertaking prove effectuall for the producing of a multiplied Trade, even to the utmoſt degree poſſible, (at leaſt to thoſe who are willing to uſe the means) and by conſequence a capacity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more <hi>per annum,</hi> upon much leſſe profit in the pound then ordinary, [as is proved, Lib 1. Sect. 7.] and all this with ready pay; ſo as the aforeſaid way of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſtock, and the increaſe thereof, being already declared to be of ſo vaſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there ſeems to remain no <hi>further means undiſcovered, that is requiſite to make this undertaking prove effectuall, for the producing of all the four Properties eſſentiall to a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Trade,</hi> (already mentioned) which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>And this will appear the more evidently, if it be conſidered that as thoſe who ſhall thus agree to take this new kind of money, may hereby increaſe the quantity thereof in ſuch ſort, as to multiply their trading to the utmoſt degree poſſible; ſo by means of ſuch an extraordinary quick Trade, it followes (I ſay) from what hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated [Lib. 1. Sect.
7.] that they ſhall be able both to buy their ware much cheaper, and ſell for much leſſe profit in the pound then others, yet gain much more <hi>per annum,</hi> and conſequently underſell them, and that in no ſmall proportion.</p>
               <p>Which ſeeing (as may appear by the ſequell) it will be for their advantage to ſell as cheap as they can afford, it muſt needs come to paſſe, that all others who are not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſit ſtill, muſt uſe ſome means whereby they may be able to ſell as cheap as they; and they in the mean time having got the ſtart of them, being every day able to ſell cheaper then formerly, ſhall thereby inforce others to ſell yet cheaper, and ſo on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, whereby the price of commodity muſt of neceſſity fall from time to time, ſo as all ſorts of ware muſt needs be every day cheaper then other.</p>
               <p>Whereas contrarily, if trading were not increaſed <hi>remarkably</hi> to ſome perſons
<hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely diſtinguiſhed</hi> from others, no company of men would be in ſo fair a capacity of making an advantage by ſelling ſtill cheaper then others; ſo as though by an increaſe of trade, the price of commodity might fall, (according to what is already in Lib. 1. Sect. 7. demonſtrated,) yet not ſo ſpeedily and effectually as by this meanes it muſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this reſpect alſo, ſeeing a fall in the price of commodity, is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage not onely to the people in generall, but in many reſpects (as I could prove at large) unto trade it ſelfe, it is requiſite that this new kind of money ſhould be current at the firſt only amongſt a few, whereby to inable them, through the quickneſſe of their trading, to underſell others.</p>
               <p>Neither can this their being able to underſell others, by the quickneſſe of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, be any juſt ground of exception againſt their practice, ſeeing any perſon that doth but put out the ſame <hi>flag</hi> with them, will (by being publikely noted for one that is agreed to take this new kind of money,) thereby multiply his takings therein, that is, his trading, and conſequently put himſelf into the ſame capacity of underſelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which
<hi>flag</hi> to hang out will not be any trouble or charge worth the naming; and therefore (ſeeing this new kind of money will yeeld the ſum it is taken for, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable loſſe) he that will not take this courſe, if others [thereby underſelling him] do ingroſſe the trade to themſelves, the fault is his own: Thus in brief, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Objection, and ſo I refer you to the Section following.</p>

               <p>The truth of this cannot be queſtioned, if we do but conſider how common a thing it is, for men to deal each with other, upon the bare <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Bill</hi> of ſuch as they judge ſufficient, and upon this <hi>Credit,</hi> to ſell for <hi>three</hi> or <hi>ſix Moneths time;</hi> wherein beſides the hazard for want of <hi>ſufficient ſecurity,</hi> there is a loſs both to the <hi>Buyer</hi> and to the <hi>Seller;</hi> ſeeing he that <hi>Buyes</hi> pays for his <hi>Commodity</hi> ſo much the more in price, as if he had paid <hi>Intereſt</hi> after the rate of eight pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> for the time the <hi>money</hi> is forborn, and he that
<hi>ſells</hi> hath for that time no profit of his <hi>Stock,</hi> more then if he had put his
<hi>Money</hi> out to <hi>Uſury;</hi> which one time with another, muſt needs be leſs then what men generally gain by their <hi>Trades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:170618:26"/>And beſides, this loſs to both parties, men by dealing upon
<hi>Truſt,</hi> do ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately involve their own <hi>Credits</hi> and <hi>Stocks</hi> with other mens, as few do certainly know what their own <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> are worth, much leſs what degree of ſafety or danger there is in truſting others; ſo as many thouſands that begin with a good <hi>Stock,</hi> looſe by this means not onely the profit but the Principal; as is hereafter more fully declared.</p>
               <p>Yet, ſeeing all <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> do frequently part with their <hi>Ware</hi> upon
<hi>Credit,</hi> (I ſay) rather then turn away a <hi>Chapman;</hi> how much more willingly would they take that money for their <hi>Ware,</hi> which though <hi>not current by Law,</hi> will yield the value without any conſiderable loſs, if ſold to the <hi>Gold-Smith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In caſe it be objected, that poſſibly every man will fear that he ſhall not meet with ſuch as will take this <hi>money</hi> from him again, and conſequently no man at all will take it.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that though any man ſhould be ſubject to this <hi>Fear,</hi> yet he will judge it greater wiſdom in him to take it, then to ſell his <hi>ware</hi> upon <hi>credit;</hi> becauſe that for a need he is able to ſell this <hi>money</hi> to the <hi>Gold-ſmith,</hi> (if he cannot make it to be taken,) and yet in the mean time is never the leſs able to take up
<hi>ware</hi> upon <hi>Credit,</hi> then if he had ſold his own <hi>ware</hi> upon
<hi>Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence, it may be concluded upon ſafe and ſolid grounds; that for as much as every man (though he ſhould not know where to put off this <hi>money,</hi> for <hi>Commodity</hi>) would find much more reaſon to take it, then to ſell his <hi>ware</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Credit,</hi> therefore very few (if any at all) would refuſe it; (at leaſt ſome one or other of moſt
<hi>Trades</hi> would take it) and conſequently, men would be yet the more willing to take it, becauſe they know where to procure <hi>Commodities</hi> of all ſorts for it.</p>
               <p>So that it is now diſcovered, <hi>how this</hi> ſuppſed prejudice of the people, <hi>which ſeemes the main, and as far as doth appear the onely obſtruction, that otherwiſe might hinder the ſpeedy effect of this Enterpriſe, is or may be totally removed,</hi> viz. <hi>by making this new kind of money</hi> (though the people be never ſo much prejudiced againſt it,) <hi>to be of ſuch reall value, as may yield the ſum it is taken for, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs, if ſold to the Gold-ſmith,</hi> for that in this caſe, few (I ſay) will refuſe it.</p>
               <p>VVhich Expedient muſt needs take place the more effectually, the rather for that the fewer there be, who have made themſelves publickly noted, for ſuch as are agreed to take this <hi>new kind of mony,</hi> the greater will be their <hi>advantage,</hi> who ſhall put out the ſaid
<hi>Flag</hi> or <hi>Sign,</hi> in multiplying their trading thereby; And beſides the putting out of the ſaid <hi>Flag</hi> or <hi>Sign,</hi> they may (if they pleaſe) cauſe their <hi>Names, Trades,</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of aboad, to be publiſhed in <hi>print,</hi> that ſuch as pleaſe may know where to ſend unto them: both which for that they may be done without any conſiderable trouble, hazard, difficulty, charge, or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to counter-poiſe the ſame, will be a great inducement unto all rational men, to ſtrive who ſhall be the firſt in this attempt; ſo as this money being <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> with at leaſt ſome of every
<hi>Trade</hi> or Calling, there can be no occaſion to diſpoſe of it (I ſay) in any Commodity, but it will be thereby known where ſuch Commodity may be had for it: Upon which ground, I might again <hi>conclude a more full diſcovery of that which was here to be demonſtrated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to make this new kind of money the more <hi>current</hi> if need require; thoſe of this Company may agree to affix unto all their <hi>Commodities,</hi> a <hi>Note</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the
<hi>price</hi> at which they are minded to ſell the ſame; binding themſelves <hi>neither to take leſs, nor ask more</hi> then that <hi>price,</hi> except paid in <hi>this new kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170618:26"/>and to abate two ſhillings on the pound of that price, for ſo much as they ſhall be paid in <hi>ſuch new kind of money,</hi> and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Now in this caſe, if the <hi>rate</hi> thus affixed upon their <hi>Commodities,</hi> be but as cheap as others can afford, whereof they abate two ſhillings on the pound, if paid in this new kind of <hi>money;</hi> then it muſt needs follow, that (ſeeing none can afford to ſell their
<hi>Commodities</hi> ſo cheap as thoſe of this Company, and they not ſo cheap by two ſhillings on the pound, as if paid in <hi>this new kind of money</hi>) thoſe who have occaſion to <hi>buy Commodity,</hi> and are willing to obtain it <hi>at the beſt hand,</hi> muſt of neceſſity firſt procure ſome of <hi>this new kind of money,</hi> wherewith to pay for the ſame; and may afford to give <hi>ready money,</hi> with above 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the pound advance, rather then be without it.</p>
               <p>Thus, if there be but a <hi>place</hi> and <hi>hour</hi> of the <hi>day</hi> appointed, whereby ſuch as would <hi>Exchange</hi> of the <hi>one ſort of money for the other,</hi> may meet together; it is evident, that this will invite moſt of thoſe who have any occaſion to buy
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,</hi> (whoſe number is never ſmall) to attend at the ſaid time and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and there to proffer of the <hi>ordinary ſort of money</hi> for <hi>this new kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and that with ſome advance, if it cannot be otherwiſe obtained, as ſhall be more fully cleared hereafter. And conſequently if this courſe be taken, it will be no more difficulty to procure of the one ſort of <hi>money</hi> for the other, then it is to get <hi>half a crown</hi> exchanged for <hi>two ſhillings and a ſix-pence;</hi> in which reſpect it is manifeſt, that <hi>all wiſe men, will take the oneſort of money as freely as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude, that it is ſufficiently demonſtrated, how the ſuppoſed
<hi>prejudice of the people</hi> againſt <hi>this new kind of money; which is the main, (and as far as doth appear the only) obſtruction, that otherwiſe might hinder the ſpeedy effect of this enterpriſe, may be totally removed;</hi> which was the thing in this place to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

<hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of this Land.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end this <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> might appear to be of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as indeed it is; I have in the former part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe premiſed ſeveral things, neceſſary to be ſuggeſted, and ſeriouſly pondered by way of preparation to the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof. And therefore if any who peruſing the ſame, ſhould turn firſt to this place; ſuppoſing to find therein the ſum of all that elſe-where is diſcuſſed, and ſo intend to ſave themſelves a labour of reading the <hi>precedent</hi> or <hi>ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> parts thereof; I earneſtly deſire ſuch perſons to ſpare the pains of reading any part of this Diſcourſe at all. For this Treatiſe being as it were a diſcovery of a <hi>new Art,</hi> cannot chuſe but require (as all other arts, at the firſt learning of them do,) more pains to the clear underſtanding thereof, then that of once reading it over, and therefore much more then the viewing of ſome few parts or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels here and there diſorderly: So as I am certain the firſt reading of it, can at the moſt but prepare men for a more clear underſtanding thereof, upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third peruſal.</p>
               <p>He therefore, who ſhall think it too great a taske to read this Treatiſe twice or thrice over, for gaining the knowledge of that <hi>Art whereby to live comfortably in the World;</hi> (for that I am certain it doth effectually diſcover) may (as I ſaid) reſt contented as he is.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, if any doubt whether their <hi>labor</hi> in thus doing may be loſt, I acknowledge it is impoſſible, that men ſhould be freed from this <hi>doubt,</hi> except they would be perſwaded to run that <hi>hazard,</hi> which at the worſt can but prove ſo much
<hi>loſt labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certain it is, that the <hi>paynes</hi> (beſides other things) which the deviſing and
<hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing</hi> of a work of this nature doth neceſſarily require, cannot chuſe but be much beyond ſuch <hi>labour</hi> of reading thereof, which being done, will (aſſuredly) render much more then a proportionable recompence.</p>
               <p>And therefore (not to detain you longer) I proceed <hi>(In order to the unfolding of the aforeſaid Parable,) to ſhew the only feaſible means, whereby both to revive and multiply the decayed Trade and Riches of this Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now conſidering, that if <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> ſhould be forced to defray the Charges of Family-Proviſion, Rent, and other things in the Commodities properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170618:28"/>to their own Profeſſion, (that is the <hi>Shoemaker</hi> in <hi>Shoes,</hi> the <hi>Habber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher</hi> in <hi>Hatts,</hi> and the like,) it muſt needs produce many great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (they being to pay the ſame to thoſe perhaps that have no need of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) it followes that ſuch exchange of one Commodity for another, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ordinarily and frequently done, without the mediation of ſome other thing, which being <hi>accepted</hi> inſtead of the goods parted with, ought to be a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>real Security</hi> to the
<hi>Receiver,</hi> for obtaining other goods of like or greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of ſuch <hi>Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is no doubt, but that the due conſideration of this, (together with mens daily experience of the neceſſity thereof,) did occaſion at firſt that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Expedient of a general and joynt <hi>Agreement</hi> (<hi>mentioned Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.) to put a certain value or eſtimation upon <hi>mettalls,</hi> (out of which, <hi>money</hi> or
<hi>coyne</hi> is formed,) and accordingly to accept thereof, which otherwiſe is of no worth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuch <hi>firm Security</hi> before ſpecified.</p>
               <p>So as it is to be obſerved, that there is not at all any true worth (I ſay) in the beſt
<hi>money</hi> or <hi>mettall</hi> that this Earth can afford, further then as by being
<hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted</hi> for things of <hi>real value,</hi> it gives to him that ſo
<hi>accepts</hi> thereof, <hi>ſecurity</hi> for obtaining ſome other. Commodity of
<hi>like</hi> or <hi>greater value;</hi> ſeeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (I ſay) ſuch <hi>mettall</hi> would be of no advantage to the owner.</p>
               <p>Hereby, that which I noted before in the place laſt cited is manifeſt, namely; that
<hi>money,</hi> is given to men for their Commodities, upon no other accompt then as an
<hi>Evidence</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> (that is as it were a TOKEN or TICKET) <hi>to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie how far forth, other men are indebted for, and ingaged to recompence the fruits of their Labors or poſseſſions by Commedities of ſome other kind, inſtead of thoſe that for ſuch money they parted with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from hence it is evident, that if matters can poſſibly be ordered ſo, as any thing elſe beſides <hi>money,</hi> (whatſoever it be,) may give as good <hi>ſecurity</hi> to the poſſeſſor, for obtaining Commodities thereupon at pleaſure, as ſo much ready money would do (the ſame being both as difficult to <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and eaſie to <hi>transfer from one to another</hi>) it muſt needes) giving I ſay as good <hi>ſecurity,</hi> &amp;c.) be
<hi>in all reſpects as good as money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it being clear, by what hath been demonſtrated, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. &amp;
4. That without a greater ſale of <hi>Commodity,</hi> there cannot be a greater <hi>Trade.</hi> That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mens receiving a greater quantity, either of <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Credit,</hi> (Commodity not falling in price) there cannot be a greater <hi>ſale of Commodity</hi> amongſt them. That without increaſing the <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>Current,</hi> either of <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Credit,</hi> men cannot receive a greater quantity thereof in the ſame time.</p>
               <p>And it being evident, That in any place where there is no <hi>Mynes</hi> of <hi>Silver</hi> or
<hi>Gold,</hi> it is not eaſie to increaſe the quantity or <hi>Current,</hi> either of
<hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Credit,</hi> upon all occaſions to any proportion needful, and that beſides <hi>Money</hi> there is nothing except <hi>Credit,</hi> upon which men can frequently &amp; conveniently ſell their <hi>Commodities:</hi> It muſt follow, that as the caſe now ſtands with us, <hi>the only feaſible means, whereby both to receive and multiply the decayed Trade of this Land, is by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing amongſt Tradeſmen ſome firm and known Credit or Security, equal to that of the Chamber of</hi> London, <hi>Banke of</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>or any Bills of</hi> Exchange, <hi>which being given in written or printed Evidences, may be fit to transfer from hand to</hi> Whereby the multiplication thereof throughout the Land, may produce the ſame effect in order to the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> as the increaſe of ſo much
<hi>Money</hi> amongſt them would do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:170618:28"/>And this the rather for that (as is clear by what hath been already demonſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) <hi>money,</hi> though it ſhould never ſo much encreaſe amongſt us at this time, yet either the fears of <hi>War</hi> (though they were groundles,) or the preſent deadneſs of <hi>Trading,</hi> would occaſion it to be hoarded up even as faſt (perhaps) as it ſhould ſo increaſe to the great obſtruction of its revolution, through the hands of <hi>Tradeſmen;</hi> which will not at all hinder the <hi>quick current</hi> of ſuch <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> as are before mentioned; whereby
<hi>Trade</hi> being once revived, it ſhall both incourage and neceſſitate as quick a revolution of <hi>money</hi> as of ſuch <hi>Bills,</hi> and this not without a great
<hi>Increaſe</hi> in the quantity of <hi>Bullogne</hi> brought from other parts, as ſhall hereafter be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing (as I noted before) an objection againſt the uſe of that means without which any enterpriſe cannot be effected, doth by conſequence argue, as ſtrongly againſt all endeavours for attempting that enterpriſe; it followes that nothing can be alleaged againſt the multiplying of ſuch a <hi>firm and known credit amongſt a people, whoſe trade is at preſent dead;</hi> but what muſt carry a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient weight againſt any endeavour, of reviving their decayed <hi>Trade;</hi> which as I have already proved no earthly Inconvenience is able to Counter-poiſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that if matters can by any means be ordered ſo, as theſe <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Evidences,</hi> may give as <hi>good and firm ſecurity to the poſſeſſors, for obtaining Commodities thereupon at pleaſure, as ſo much ready money would do, (or for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ready money if need require as any Bills of Exchange) and be made as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to Counterfeit and as eaſy to transfer from one to another, as money,</hi> (all which I ſhall hereafter demonſtrate) they muſt needs be in all reſpects near, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as good as
<hi>money;</hi> And conſequently (in order to the unfolding of the aforeſaid Parable) will prove <hi>the onely feaſible means whereby to revive and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the decayed Trade and Riches of this Land;</hi> which was the thing here to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N regard the greateſt part of mens <hi>returns,</hi> in moſt places of the World, are either upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of particular perſons, as here in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe, by means of ſome <hi>Braſs</hi> or <hi>Copper</hi> money, made <hi>current</hi> by a <hi>Law,</hi> as in <hi>Spain, Holland</hi> and other places, both which are bad enough, though the former much more liable to hazard then the latter, as I could prove at large.</p>
               <p>And conſidering, that notwithſtanding the ſo many and great Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of
<hi>Trading</hi> upon ſuch <hi>private credit,</hi> ſo long experienced by men of all
<hi>trades</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170618:29"/>and Nations, it ſtill continues ſo common a thing amongſt them, to make uſe of their <hi>own words and credits,</hi> inſtead of money, for transferring goods to and from one another, (though not conſtrained by <hi>Law</hi> thereunto.) This conſtant practice of it, by the moſt wary, skilful and prudent men, is an undoubted ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that all the aforeſaid Inconveniences put together, do not fully out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the Commodity and neceſſity thereof.</p>
               <p>For it is in this caſe, as with <hi>Merchants</hi> adventuring beyond Sea, who though ſometimes divers of them loſe their whole <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and perhaps much more, by ſurprizal or Shipwrack; yet if there were not one time with another, more got then loſt by ſuch adventures, we might confidently conclude, that none would inter meddle therewith at all, much leſs would any take ſo ſmall a matter in the hundred, for inſurance.</p>
               <p>This way therefore of trading upon private credit, being the main <hi>hinge,</hi> upon which the much greater part of <hi>ware,</hi> is returned in moſt places of the <hi>world,</hi> is in ſuch ſort uſeful to us here in <hi>England,</hi> as if it ſhould be left without intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſome other way inſtead thereof, muſt needs occaſion our already decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Trade,</hi> to be yet much worſe then it is.</p>
               <p>Now, having in the fore-going Section, given ſome light to the diſcovery of that other way; it will not be amiſs here, to ſhew the excellency thereof, by a compariſon of it, with the aforeſaid ordinary way of dealing upon private <hi>Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reference whereunto it cannot be denyed, but that this uſual way of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> on private <hi>Credit,</hi> is through mens loſſes by deſperat <hi>debts,</hi> a far greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the generality of men, then the payment of <hi>taxes, exciſe,</hi> and all other
<hi>aſſeſſments;</hi> Seeing it appears by frequent experience, that not <hi>one Tradeſman</hi> of any conſiderable dealing amongſt <hi>an hundred,</hi> could ever with his beſt diſcretion prevent the danger of ſome conſiderable loſs firſt or laſt, by this means occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>Whereas, if it could be deviſed how all ſuch <hi>Credit</hi> which men ſhall need to inter-meddle with, in a way of <hi>trade,</hi> might be made as ſure and firm, as that (I ſay) of <hi>the Chamber of London, Bank of Amſterdam,</hi> or any <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> (which how to effect, I doubt not to diſcover,) certainly men would not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch hazzard, as at all conſiderable.</p>
               <p>And though it be ordinary, for men to eſteeme of <hi>money</hi> much before the <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Bonds</hi> of ſuch whoſe <hi>Credit</hi> is not good; yet it is no unuſual thing for them, to part even with <hi>ready money,</hi> in hopes of a ſmall profit of Intereſt, upon thoſe private <hi>Bonds</hi> of particular perſons, to which the <hi>Sureties</hi> are
<hi>eſteemed ſufficient,</hi> accompting themſelves in this reſpect, not prejudiced but advantaged, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch <hi>Bonds</hi> inſtead of <hi>money,</hi> and conſequently would much rather accept of them inſtead of <hi>Commodity</hi> in a way of <hi>Trade,</hi> if the
<hi>Security</hi> thereof were known.</p>
               <p>Yet, if it be conſidered, that ſuch private <hi>Bonds</hi> cannot do the ſervice of
<hi>ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> by being generally accepted for <hi>Commodity,</hi> though never ſo good a bargain be proffered; becauſe the <hi>ſecurity</hi> for making them good is <hi>not publickly known</hi> (the rather for that the party who makes ſuch proffer, knows not where to find one, to take them of him again for ready <hi>money,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Commodity</hi> as he ſtands in preſent need of;) it follows, that in caſe the <hi>ſecurity</hi> for making them good, either
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170618:29"/>in <hi>money</hi> or <hi>Commodity,</hi> ſhall appeare not onely
<hi>firme</hi> and <hi>ſufficient,</hi> but as <hi>publiquely</hi> and <hi>generally knowne</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Chamber of London,</hi> &amp;c. It muſt needs be much more acceptable to all wiſe men in lieu either of <hi>money</hi> or <hi>Commodity,</hi> then otherwiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much above the <hi>uſuall way, of trading</hi> upon the <hi>Credit of</hi> private perſons.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The ordinary way of dealing upon Credit here in England, being to take mens worder promiſe for the debt;</hi> it come's to paſſe, that though a man hath ſold never ſo much
<hi>Commodity</hi> upon <hi>Credit,</hi> yet he cannot upon ſuch <hi>word</hi> or
<hi>promiſe</hi> goe and re-furniſh himſelf with <hi>new commodity,</hi> without ingaging his own eſtate to pay the <hi>debt,</hi> (as in <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the <hi>Bills</hi> each of other, to the great <hi>Improvement</hi> of their <hi>Trade</hi> they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually do.)</p>
               <p>Which incovenience if it be not remedied here in <hi>England,</hi> it muſt needs come to paſſe, that though <hi>credit</hi> ſhould be encreaſed never ſomuch amongſt us, (and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt ſecure terms that are conſiſtent with things on <hi>earth</hi>) yet men could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to ſell more <hi>commodity</hi> upon ſuch <hi>credit,</hi> then one year with another they receive <hi>ready money</hi> for; becauſe in this caſe, look how much
<hi>ware</hi> is parted with, and is not at one time or other paid for in <hi>money,</hi> is totally loſt.</p>
               <p>So as if it happen that any conſiderable quantity of <hi>money</hi> be hoarded up, our
<hi>trade</hi> for want of the revolution of ſo much <hi>money</hi> in the yeare, as formerly muſt needs be obſtructed proportionably; notwithſtanding ſuch multiplied <hi>credit:</hi> And oftentimes it happens, that the generality of men faile of being able to pay their
<hi>debts,</hi> at the time appointed (and thereby loſe their <hi>credit</hi>) by reaſon of ſome ſuddain obſtruction in the revolution of <hi>moneys:</hi> So that <hi>trading</hi> on
<hi>credit</hi> (if it be not otherwiſe ordered then now it is,) cannot but be deſtroyed, (and by that means <hi>trade</hi> alſo) if the <hi>current</hi> of <hi>money</hi> be not maintained amongſt us; which <hi>current</hi> of <hi>money</hi> (I ſay) is prevented uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally either by deadneſſe of <hi>trading,</hi> whereby men find no <hi>profit,</hi> or fear of <hi>war,</hi> whereby they find no <hi>ſafety</hi> in laying out their <hi>moneys,</hi> from neither of which we in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as things now ſtand, can expect to be ſuddainly freed, except by ſome ſuch means as is here propoſed; which by the bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> doth tend effectually to both.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all therefore in few words, <hi>Seeing for that we cannot increaſe money at pleaſure to any quantity needfull; we have no feaſible means whereby to quicken Trade, (as I ſaid before) but by multiplying a firme and knowne credit amongſt Tradeſmen, fit to tranſmit from hand to hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the worth of money it ſelfe, conſiſts in being as it were a <hi>token</hi> or
<hi>Ticket</hi> for obtaining goods at pleaſure, which otherwiſe would be of no advantage to the owner.</p>
               <p>That though <hi>Bills</hi> and <hi>Bonds,</hi> if the ſecurity for payment of them be not good, are ſlighted in compariſon of <hi>money;</hi> yet if ſuch ſecurity be made unqueſtionable, they are ſo farre forth eſteemed, as that men (I ſay) part even with
<hi>money</hi> it ſelfe upon ſuch ſecurity.</p>
               <p>That there is nothing can be named wherein <hi>credit</hi> comes ſhort of <hi>money,</hi> but in one of the three reſpects before inſiſted on; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>ſecurity</hi> it gives, is either <hi>not ſo good,</hi> or <hi>not ſo well known,</hi> or <hi>not ſo eaſie to be tranſmitted to others,</hi> all which by the uſe of ſuch <hi>Bills,</hi> as are before mentioned, will be prevented.</p>
               <p>Hereupon at laſt, I reduced all my diverſity of thoughts unto this firm concluſion, That if the mutuall <hi>agreement</hi> of men, could by any lawfull means be made effectuall, for laying a <hi>Foundation,</hi> [as I ſaid before] of the beſt and moſt known ſecurity that things on earth are capable of; no whit inferiour to that of the <hi>Chamber of London, Banke of Amſterdam,</hi> or any <hi>Bills of Exchange;</hi> which <hi>given in ſuch printed Evidences, might like money be transferred from one to another.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170618:30"/>And that ſome way were <hi>found, whereby ſuch to whom theſe Bills are proffered, may be inabled as eaſily to diſcover any counterfeit, as they can any clipped or counterfeited coyn in of money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would beyond all controverſie, not onely tend effectually toinereaſe [even to the utmoſt degree poſſible] the <hi>Trade</hi> of thoſe that ſhould make uſe thereof, but much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all the aforeſaid particulars, that kind of ſlender <hi>credit,</hi> upon which men (I ſay) do frequently tranſmit conſiderable proportions of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> one to another (to the utter undoing of many thouſands that begin with a great ſtock) And in all the three aforeſaid particulars, be neer, if not altogether equivalent to <hi>money</hi> it ſelfe, and indeed prove both to the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in <hi>generall;</hi> and eſpecially to the perſons that deale therein, <hi>a far more effectuall means for improving of Trade, then ſo much ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> [which I ſay men are apt to hoard up] And that therefore the means thereunto is not to be ſlighted, but incouraged.</p>
               <p>All which things, in order to the diſcovery of the Excellancy of this means for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Trade,</hi> by a compariſon thereof, with the ordinary way of <hi>trading</hi> upon private <hi>credit;</hi> were thought neceſſary to be here inſerted, which was the thing here undertaken.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the ſecond book diſcuſſed what the ſeverall advantages would be, <hi>in caſe a Mine of Gold diſcovered in this Land, were reſigned up to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſuch as ſhould become ingaged by Bond, to reſtore within ſix moneths warning, both the uſe and poſſeſsion thereof; eſpecially if matters were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo as the ſaid Gold, might not be generally current at the firſt, nor ever at all acceptable to be hoarded up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now to conſider, whether the <hi>free Loane</hi> of ſuch <hi>Bills</hi> as are already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, would not be altogether as great an advantage to the <hi>Borrowers,</hi> and to <hi>Trade</hi> in generall, as if the ſame were ſuch <hi>Gold. In caſe that firſt ſecurity equall</hi> [I ſay] <hi>to that of the</hi> Chamber of London, &amp;c. <hi>were given to make them good in money within ſix moneths after the demanding thereof; and, that ſecondly there were a way found whereby any Bill, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counterfeit or added to the number, for which there is ſecurity given, might be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as eaſily as clipped or counterfeit coyn in receiving of money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that ſuch <hi>Bills</hi> as are already mentioned would not at the firſt, be ſo generally current, as our ordinary ſort of <hi>money,</hi> nor yet at all acceptable to be
<hi>horaded up</hi> by any, doth of it ſelfe ſufficiently appeare; Whereby [as is demouſtrated <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.] they muſt needs prove a far more effectual means for multiplying the <hi>Trade</hi> of all thoſe that deal therein, then if it were otherwaies.</p>
               <p>But the chief queſtion is; whether they would become ſo far forth current, as the aforeſaid <hi>Gold</hi> would have been: For it was demonſtrated [<hi>Lib</hi> 2.
<hi>Sect.</hi> 5.] That if <hi>Gold</hi> were diſperſed amongſt men, or any <hi>Mettall</hi> of ſuch reall <hi>value</hi> as [though not current by Law, nor acceptable to be <hi>hoarded</hi> up by any] would yield the money it is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170618:30"/>taken for, without any conſiderable loſſe, if ſold to the
<hi>Goldſmith:</hi> In this caſe, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there could be no great hazard in taking it, whether it were current at all or no) therefore no wiſe man but would take it, much rather then continue the practiſe (which is ſo very common) of ſelling his ware upon <hi>truſt,</hi> and conſequently it would become ſufficiently <hi>current</hi> for the carrying on of this
<hi>Attempt,</hi> eſpecially if this <hi>Company</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Ware cheaper by 2. s. on the pound then ordinary, when paid in this <hi>Gold,</hi> and not otherwaies; it ſhould thereby come to paſſe, that Commodity could not be had at the beſt hand without it.</p>
               <p>Now, to prove that theſe <hi>Bills</hi> would be altogether as <hi>current</hi> as ſuch
<hi>gold,</hi> let it be conſidered, that men (as is declared in the precedent Section) do not ſpare to part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>gold</hi> it ſelfe, or any money whatſoever, upon <hi>Bills, Bonds,</hi> or ſuch like; in caſe the <hi>ſecurity</hi> for making them good be ſufficient; So, as if there be any means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſettle a <hi>ſecurity</hi> equall to what is already expreſſed, and to prevent the <hi>counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>multiplying</hi> of ſuch
<hi>Bills</hi> as ſhall be given out upon ſuch <hi>ſecurity,</hi> theſe <hi>Bills</hi> muſt needs (in reſpect of their <hi>ſecurity</hi>) prove equivalent to <hi>Mettal</hi> of as reall value, I ſay, as any which the <hi>Goldſmith</hi> will give ready money for.</p>
               <p>And from hence it is evident, that if ſuch <hi>ſecurity</hi> be given to make good theſe
<hi>Bills</hi> in ready money, <hi>within ſix moneths after the demanding thereof;</hi> in this caſe, though no <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſhould be allowed for that ſix moneths time, yet thoſe that put their money out to <hi>Uſury</hi> (repreſented by the <hi>Goldſmith</hi>) will upon ſuch <hi>ſecurity</hi> advance ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> in caſe they be allowed a <hi>rebatement of Intereſt for ſix moneths,</hi> which though reckoned to ten per centum, amounts but to 12. d. in the pound.</p>
               <p>Now, if men ſhould refuſe to take theſe <hi>Bills</hi> for commodity, at a higher rate then 19, s. in the pound, yet ſeeing thoſe that put their moneys out to <hi>Intereſt</hi> will give as much and more for them at any time in <hi>ready money,</hi> they might (I ſay) in this caſe <hi>have ready money for them, without any loſſe at all;</hi> and this muſt needs make them prove to all thoſe that deale therein, as good as any <hi>Mettal which ſold to the Goldſmith would yeeld the money it is taken for, without any loſſe at all;</hi> Conſequently, as far forth <hi>current</hi> as any ſuch <hi>mettal</hi> before ſpoken of would be. <hi>viz.</hi> Abundantly ſufficient for the carrying on of this <hi>Enterpriſe;</hi> eſpecially (I ſay) if this <hi>Company</hi> (ſelling their commodities above 2. s. on the pound cheaper then ordinary, when paid in theſe <hi>Bills</hi>) it ſhould thereby come to paſſe, that commodities could not be had at the beſt hand without them, the Conſequence of which ſhall be declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude, that the free loan of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> (the ſecurity being ſuch as is formerly declared) would be altogether as great an advantage to the <hi>borrowers,</hi> as if the ſame were ſuch <hi>gold</hi> as is already mentioned, concerning which <hi>ſecrrity</hi> I ſhall in the next Section demonſtrate the ſufficiency of it.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, if it be queſtioned whether theſe <hi>Bills</hi> may not be
<hi>counterfeited,</hi> or rather whether thoſe who are intruſted therein, may not <hi>add</hi> to the number for which there is ſuch ſecurity given; I ſay in this caſe, as before concerning the ſaid <hi>gold:</hi> Let it be admitted, (for how much ſoever ſeemingly impoſſible it ſhall be fully made good) that there were a way found <hi>whereby not any perſon whatſoever, (though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed or intruſted in or about the printing or making of them) could any waies adde to the number for which there is ſuch ſecurity given, [much leſſe counterfeit any, but even thoſe who are to receive ſuch Bill, might eaſily diſcover the ſame not to be within the ſaid number;</hi> yea, [I ſay] more eaſily then they can clipped or counterfeit coyn in receiving therof; And if what I ſay in this particular beſteemed impoſſible to be done; men may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to intermeddle in this Undertaking, untill the truth thereof be demonſtrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for their full ſatisfaction:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>debts</hi> cannot be made over to others without <hi>Aſsignments</hi> as money may.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If theſe <hi>Bills</hi> be made payable not to this or that man by name, but onely in generall to the bearer thereof; (except ſecurity be profered to prove he hath no right therein) and withall, he that accepts of them be required to give a full
<hi>diſcharge</hi> to him of whom he receives them, (depending for his ſatisfaction upon the ſaid company) then [by the <hi>Law</hi> of this <hi>Land</hi>] he can recover nothing from the perſon of whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and yet [though he have no <hi>Aſsignment</hi>] may inforce the Company to make them good upon producing of the Bills, becauſe they have ſo ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo as there ſeems to be no neceſſity of <hi>Aſsignments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, [though as matters might be ordered, ſuch <hi>aſsignments</hi> may be made as little trouble ſome as <hi>receipts</hi> upon the payment of money] yet I doubt not but the

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſuch <hi>Bills</hi> cannot be divided into ſmall parcells, to the value of <hi>ſhillings</hi> or <hi>ſixpences,</hi> as occaſion may require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No more can <hi>gold,</hi> yet there is <hi>ſilver</hi> enough to ſerve for exchange up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions as are needfull; neither can this prove any greater an inconvenience then is incident to thoſe <hi>Bills,</hi> which [as I noted before] they uſe in
<hi>Flanders</hi> in a way of <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet [when opportunity ſerves] I ſhall diſcover a way, how any one may take up ware of ſeverall Tradeſmen, to the value of two or three ſhillings, or leſſe, upon one and the ſame <hi>Bill;</hi> and how this may be done with eaſe, and as much ſecurity, as if the ſame were paid for in money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe Bills will not be current beyond Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo much the better, for the exporting of <hi>money,</hi> or that which goeth for ſuch, is ſo great a prejudice to <hi>trade,</hi> as all <hi>States</hi> do generally uſe their beſt endeavours to prevent the ſame, for as we ſee by experience the late exporting of <hi>gold,</hi> hath been no ſmall prejudice to <hi>England:</hi> Yet they paſſing currently here, will procure ſuch <hi>Commodity,</hi> as being exported beyond Sea, will be never the leſſe worth for being bought with thoſe <hi>Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which when diſcovered, it will follow; <hi>that the means laſt propounded for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Trade</hi> [being placed upon ſuch <hi>ſecurity</hi> as aforeſaid] <hi>wil come to one and the ſame effect with that which was mentioned in the aforeſaid Parable:</hi> Which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>

<hi>per C.</hi> one time with another thereby; it follows, that the ſaid Inſurers and Undertakers, may if they be carefull, make the ſaid one <hi>per cent.</hi> to be more then ſufficient, to defray one time with another the loſſes incident to the Loane of theſe bills; which, if at any time it do not, then ſeeing the whole Company of Inſurers are bound to make good the reſt of the loſſe [which cannot be much] out of their own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, it muſt needs make them ſo much the more carefull, to take good ſecurity of each Member that borrows of the ſaid Bills.</p>
               <p>And conſidering, that both theſe Inſurers and Undertakers, are all ſubject to the Law of the Land, to imagine that they would [as I may ſay] be ſo free and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of the loan of theſe Bills, as not to take competent ſecurity from each one that borrows of the ſame, [when I ſay they may as well preſerve themſelves from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger therein, as the ſaid ſeverall Companies in lending moneys gratis] is to ſuppoſe that men are generally ſo void of underſtanding, as to neglect the doing of that which is both poſſible and practicable, when the ſafety of their whole eſtates depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, grant that the ſaid Inſurers and Undertakers, (being ſubject I ſay to the Law, for the recovery of theſe debts] be but ſo far forth carefull in taking ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſecurity, as about one <hi>per C.</hi> may defray the charges of Inſurance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more then defray one time with another, the loſſes incident to the loan of the ſaid bills; then the ſaid Company of Inſurers ſecuring the ſaid Undertakers with their whole eſtates [if it prove otherwiſe] there can ſcarce in this caſe be any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of danger, incident to the ſaid Undertakers; and how much leſſe to thoſe that accept of theſe Bills, according to the terms propoſed, who cannot fail of obtaining thoſe terms, except not onely the whole Company of Inſurers, but alſo the whole Company of Undertakers, and not they alone, but all their ſureties do at once become unable to perform the terms propoſed; and how this ſhould happen without ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confuſion, by ſurpriſall of an enemy, or ſuch like cannot be imagined, to the danger of which the ſecurity of the <hi>Chamber</hi> of
<hi>London, Bank</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or <hi>mens trading on credit</hi> without theſe Bills, is no leſſe liable.</p>
               <p>For, if the generality of the members of this Company, have been cauſed <hi>each man for himſelf, to put in good and ſufficient ſecurity</hi> for the Bills ſo borrowed [the contrary to which muſt not be granted] it is not the failing of ſome few, that can make the loſſe ſo conſiderable, as that the eſtates of all theſe able and ſufficient men, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170618:32"/>with their ſureties, beſides the eſtates of all the Inſurers [which muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo to the generally very able] ſhould not much more then countervail ſuch loſſe; neither can it be imagined, that thoſe few can both in themſelves and ſureties fail ſo, as not to be able to make good, the moſt part of what was ſo borrowed.</p>
               <p>All which conſidered, I may confidently conclude, that <hi>this ſecurity, as matters may be ordered, wil not be any whit inferiour to that of the</hi> Chamber of London, Bank of Amſterdam,
<hi>or any which on earth can poſſibly be given,</hi> which was the ſecond thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>And thus much may ſerve to diſcover, how <hi>the aforeſaid means for increaſe of Trade, may be effectually accompliſhed, by an agreement amongſt ſome few tradeſmen, of known and ſufficient credit.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving layed down in the laſt Section, a way how ſufficient ſecurity may be given, for making good of the aforeſaid Bills, either in money at the end of the ſix moneths, or in commodity, at a cheaper rate by 2. s. on the pound, then for money can be procured, and all this to the end that the ſaid Bills being eſtabliſhed upon ſuch firm ſecurity, might (going about currently for commodity in the place of money) not onely prevent the trouble of making them good in money, but tend to the abundant multiplication of the trade of all thoſe that deal therein.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider, <hi>what the damage in continuing the practiſe of this enterpriſe would be, in caſe being attempted, it ſhould not take effect ſo, as to occaſion that theſe Bills ſhould become any waies currant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to which, it is to be conſidered, that the members of this <hi>Company,</hi> having received ſuch proportion of the ſaid Bills, as they have put in ſecurity to make good, according to the terms propoſed, if they cannot make them to be taken for Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; in this caſe, the prejudice onely is, that they have loſt their labour in troubling themſelves ſo far, as to attempt the ſetting of this enterpriſe on foot.</p>
               <p>If having found out ſuch as are willing to deal with them upon this Credit, the ſaid members or any of them have received Commodity, and parted with their Bills, to thoſe that bring them in to the ſaid Office, to be made good in money, according or agreement: yet in regard the Company have taken ſix moneths time for the payment of them, and ſufficient ſecurity from each particular perſon, to make good his owne ſhare, it is no more then having thus [as it were] taken up Commodity upon truſt in Company with others, they muſt procure money in due time for the payment of the debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170618:33"/>If any of thoſe that have received theſe Bills for their Commodity, ſhall bring them to any of this Company, and lay them out in Commodity again, ſo as they go about for any time in ſtead of money, then ſeeing this Company do not give Bond to make good theſe Bills in money, untill the delivering of them in to the ſaid Office, and from that time take ſix moneths for payment of them, it follows that ſo long as any of them ſhal go about for Commodity [as in this caſe they are immediately made good to the Creditor, by being accepted for Commodity in the place of ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſo] the debt otherwiſe due in money, is during the time of their going about forborn.</p>
               <p>For that the ſaid ſix moneths doth not commence, untill the exchanging of them at the ſaid Office for bonds, which if this courſe take effect, will, as to the moſt of them never be required, as by the ſequell doth appear.</p>
               <p>If it happen, that ſome of this Company having got their Bills to be taken for ware, ſuch Bills are immediately brought in to the ſaid Office, to be made good in money, when others of the ſame Company having their Bills ſtill in their hands, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not procure Commodity upon them, and are yet notwithſtanding to pay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion towards the making good of thoſe that are ſo brought in; In this caſe, if they want ready money, it is but ſelling their Bills to thoſe that put their moneys out to uſe, and upon rebatement of Intereſt they may have money in hand, either to buy commodity, or pay any debt as they have occaſion: For it cannot be denied, but if this undertaking be ever like to come to any thing, the ſecurity muſt be ſuch as thoſe who put moneys out to intereſt may be willing to accept, which [I ſay] will be no hard matter to bring to paſſe.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the members of this Company, having ingaged themſelves to take theſe Bills for ware, will receive little or no money upon the ſale of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, wherewith to diſcharge thoſe that are ſent in to the ſaid Office.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; the more Bills the ſaid Company receive for their ware, the fewer they have to make good in money; and therefore it will be ſo much the eaſier for them, to provide money ſo to do, by the ſale of thoſe which they ſo receive for ware.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide; if all theſe Bills be brought in to the ſaid Office, before they be returned to any of the ſaid Company for Commodity, then in order to the making of them good in money, there will be this advantage; that all the ſaid Bills being lodged in the ſaid Office for ſix moneths, thoſe of this Ingagement cannot in this caſe be profered any thing but money for their commodity; and therefore may as wel make good theſe Bills at the end of ſix moneths (by the ſale of their commodity for money) as if they had taken up ſo much ware upon their private credit, for the like time.</p>
               <p>But, if they be not all delivered in to the ſaid Office, before thoſe of this Ingagement receive them for commodity, then the difficulty of making them good in money, will be ſo much the leſſe: For (though in this caſe ſome of this Ingagement, may be cauſed ſometimes to accept of theſe Bills for their ware, who elſe might have been profered money, Yet) theſe Bills being (I ſay, eſtabliſhed upon ſuch firm ſecurity, will yeeld thoſe that have received them for ware <hi>preſent money, upon rebatement of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> if they have neceſſary occaſion for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe to whom theſe Bills are ſold for ready money, do immediately bring them in to the ſaid Office, ſo as they are ſtill all for the moſt part lodged there; yet (I ſay) againe, it is manifeſt, that if theſe Bills were wholly lodged in the ſaid Office, the worſt that can come, is but to make them all good in money, once in about halfe a year with intereſt, that is, about the end of each halſe year, receiving the Bills, and procuring commodity thereupon, to have them all lodged in the ſaid Office for the next ſix moneths ſucceeding, and ſo perpetually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170618:33"/>For, if never ſo few of them be for any ſmall time ſtirring abroad, there is ſo much the longer time above ſix moneths given, for making good thoſe few in money; and for the reſt, it is (I ſay) no more then as if men had taken up ware upon truſt, to be made good in money at the end of ſix moneths.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>though this enterprize being attempted, ſhould not ſuddenly take effect, yet the damage in continuing the practice thereof, would not be conſiderable,</hi> which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Now if it be objected, that in putting off theſe Bills at 19. s. 2. d. for commodity, and making them good at 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. s. in money, they do in effect pay intereſt, which is a great prejudice.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that thoſe who take up ware upon truſt, do allow intereſt in the price of their commodities, ſo as the damage in this reſpect is no greater then that of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of dealing on truſt.</p>
               <p>But how to make this courſe take effect, notwithſtanding what hath been here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſo as the ſaid Bills may go about without being brought in to the ſaid Office to be made good in money, not only for the preventing of this, and all other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, but for accompliſhing of all the deſirable conſequences depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I doubt not but the way thereunto is fully and ſatisfactorily diſcovered in the two Sections following, to which therefore I refer you.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Shewing, What great probability there is, that this <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe</hi> being ſet on foot, will ſuddainly take <hi>effect,</hi> if the <hi>Rules</hi> already preſcribed (with ſome other here laid down) bee duely and carefully obſerved.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Bils being placed upon ſuch firm ſecurity as is already mentioned, and ſufficient means uſed for preventing the multiplying or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting of them, there needs no more to make this Enterpriſe take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that matters be ordered in ſuch ſort, as none can buy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity ſo cheap by 2. s. on the pound with money, as with theſe Bills, the way whereunto is already diſcovered.</p>
               <p>For, from hence it will follow, that <hi>the full worth of theſe Bills in ready money, is no leſſe then</hi> 22. <hi>s. on the pound,</hi> becauſe he that hath occaſion to buy commodity, and doth firſt purchaſe of theſe Bils, paying but 21. s. for them, doth gain the other 12. d. by the bargain; Seeing, that if he had been to pay for his commodity in money, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of 21. s. which his Bill coſt him, this Bill hath procured that commodity, which in money would have coſt him 22. s. and that at as low a rate, as in money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone could have been procured, in any place whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Now, let us obſerve but the conſequence of this: Hence it muſt needs follow, that if any man hath a mind to part with his Bills for ready money, there being a place appointed where he may meet with thoſe who (willing to procure their <hi>commodity at the loweſt rate, which without theſe Bills cannot be obtained</hi>) do attend there to give ready money for them; it is not likely that he will part with them for leſſe then 20. s. in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170618:34"/>pound, when he knows that the buyer being convinced, it will ſave him two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the pound, will be glad to give it, ſeeing a little ſaved is better then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Again, ſeeing as I ſaid before, few or none will refuſe them for commodity, at the rate they will yeeld in ready money, it follows, that few will trouble themſelves to profer them to ſale for money, when (I ſay) men will not refuſe to accept of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſo much ready money for debt or <hi>commodity;</hi> and the fewer number there is of thoſe that profer them to ſale, the more will they be ſought after and eſteemed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, that all thoſe who have not received of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> for their <hi>ware,</hi> if they intend to buy commodity at the beſt hand, muſt be forced to purchaſe them with money, although they find few, or none that care to ſell them: So as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them for ware at the rate they wil yeeld in money, will be a courteſie.</p>
               <p>Yet further, ſeeing by this meanes they will paſſe for at leaſt 20. s. in ready money, (and that ſo as the number of thoſe that would give that price, will be greater then of thoſe that will take it) it is not to be ſuppoſed that in this caſe, any will trouble the Uſurer with them at all, who cannot afford to give full 20. s. for them, becauſe he muſt have allowance of Intereſt for the ſix moneths forbearance; and much leſſe is it probable, that any will ſend them in to the ſaid Office; where after they have ſtayed ſix moneths they are to have but 20. s. in money, <hi>viz.</hi> no more then they might have before they deliver them in.</p>
               <p>And as by this means the members of this Company will have little or no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to procure money for the ſatisfying of any of theſe Bills, ſo if having any of them in their hands, they ſhould have occaſion for money, how eaſie would it be for them to get it, without either troubling the Uſurer, or allowing any intereſt in the ſale of them, by ſelling theſe Bills thoſe that (willing to buy commodity at the beſt hand) are content to give ready money for them: So as (in a word) this being done, it is manifeſt, tthat theſe Bills would be no whit leſſe, but rather <hi>more acceptable then money it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what great probability there is, <hi>that this attempt being ſet on foot, will ſuddenly take effect, if the rules already preſcribed,</hi> (although no other were proppoſed) <hi>be duely and carefully obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the more effectuall proſecution of this Enterpriſe, let it be ſuppoſed, that thoſe of this Company [rating their commodities [by a note affixed thereon, in manner afore ſaid] at ful as low a rate as others can afford] do agree, to ſell their ware at that rate, though paid all in money, but to abate 2. s. on the pound, of that price, for ſo much as they ſhall be paid in bills, the ſame not exceeding the one half of the ſum; That is to ſay, they expect for their commodity half money, and half Bills; at leaſt, that they will not allow the ſaid 2. s. abatement upon above the one half, though paid in Bills, yet that they will abate the ſaid 2. s. on the pound, upon ſo much as they ſhall be paid in Bills, not exceeding the ſaid half.</p>
               <p>I ſay 2. s. on the pound, for that to abate 2. s. on the pound upon the one half, is no more then 12. d. on the pound upon the whole, which yet will make theſe Bills as well worth 22. s. on the pound, as otherwiſe; For he that having occaſion to buy commodity, though he ſhould pay full 22. s. on the pound for theſe Bills, to make up the one half of his ſum, doth loſe nothing by the bargain, ſeeing he is allowed 2. s. on the pound, upon that half in the price of his commodities; ſo if he paies but 21. s. he ſaveth 12. d. in the pound upon all the Bills ſo bought.</p>
               <p>Therefore, by this means, although the ſaid Company underſell others but 12. d. in the pound, theſe Bills will be ſold in money at as high a price as otherwiſe, if they underſell them 22. s. and no doubt will go currently for commodity, at that price they will yeeld in money.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:170618:34"/>By this means alſo, they ſhall receive half the price of their commodities in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whereby they ſhall not onely be the better inabled to diſcharge ſuch bills as are to be made good in money, but have their takings double, to what they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be; ſeeing theſe Bills will not in this caſe paſſe through their hands, without bringing as much in money, and yet thoſe of whom they procure their commodities, will be as well content to take all their pay in bills, (if need require) as otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not engaged to make them good in money, as thoſe of this Company are.</p>
               <p>This being conſidered, it will follow, that thoſe of this Company muſt needs have more money, then to pay what are ſo brought in immediately, even much faſter then it would be demanded, which if they ſhould perform accordingly, not being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereunto, it would not only be another way, whereby ready money might be had on theſe Bills for the labour of fetching, but ſo maintain the credit of this Company, as none would trouble themſelves to demand money on their Bils, but accept of them as freely, if not more willingly, then money.</p>
               <p>All which, doth tend to ſhew what great probability there is, that <hi>this attempt being ſet on foot, will ſuddainly take effect,</hi> if the rules, already preſcribed [with thoſe other here laid downe] be duely and carefully obſerved; which was the thing here to be demonſtrated.</p>

                  <p> Shewing, What great probability there is, that this <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe</hi> being once ſet on foot, would ſuddainly take a good effect, although none of the Rules preſcribed in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Section,</hi> ſhould be obſerved.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch, as in all things that are firſt propounded, it is meet before the attempting of them, to propoſe the worſt that can probably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the proſecution thereof; Let it be admitted, that thoſe of this Company at the firſt beginning of this Enterpriſe, being not able to afford Commodity at an under-rate, it ſhould not be true, that Commodity could be got with half money, and half Bills, at a leſſe rate then with money; as was taken for granted in the former Section.</p>
               <p>Now, if from this ground, it ſhould be objected, that they would not ſuddenly go about for commodity, but be generally ſent in to the ſaid Office to be made good in money.</p>
               <p>For the anſwer of this [beſides that it is already proved, that in caſe they ſhould not ſo go about, yet the damage would be no greater then if men had taken up ſo much ware upon credit] Let us call to mind [as briefly as poſſible] what was noted before, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Uſurer upon rebatement of intereſt, will give ready meney for theſe Bills: That men rather then loſe the ſale of their commodities, are</hi> (generally) <hi>willing to truſt the ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That therefore none would refuſe theſe Bills for commoditie at the rate they will yeeld
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170618:35"/>in ready money; That if few men will refuſe them at that rate, moſt men would take them at that rate,</hi> much the rather becauſe moſt men are willing ſo to do.</p>
               <p>From all this, it may be concluded, that men knowing that they will be taken, at that rate, for commodity, (and rather then fail for money it ſelf) few or none would trouble themſelves to ſeek out the Uſurer, for procuring money thereupon; and much leſſe would tradeſmen ſend them in to the ſaid Office, where (having taken them at the ſame rate the Uſurer will give in ready money) they muſt ſtay ſix moneths for no greater profit then the intereſt of their ſtock, which tradeſmen cannot generally live upon.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe bills by this means, going about without being carryed in to the ſaid Office, ſhall not onely prevent the trouble of making them good in money, but ſo multiply the trade of thoſe that deal therein, as they ſhall ſoon be inabled to underſell others, whereby they may be in capacity to ſell commodity (being paid in theſe bills) much cheaper then for money can be any where procured.</p>
               <p>And though (if the better to effect this) they ſhould for a while ſell the one half of their ware at the ſame rate it coſt them, the conſequence <hi>[by multiplying their trading]</hi> would ſoon recompence their loſſe an hundred fold; but I need not inſiſt on this, ſeeing the ſpeedy ſucceſſe of this attempt doth not much depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that although it cannot be denied, but matters may be ordered in ſuch ſort, as thoſe who put their moneys out to intereſt, may be willing to advance ready money on thoſe bills, upon rebatement of Intereſt, for ſix moneths, which at 8. <hi>per cent.</hi> amounts not to 10. d. on the pound; yet if the Uſurer will give but 19. s. 2. d. for theſe bills in ready money, then it is not like, that any will accept of them from thoſe of this Company for commodity, at a higher rate; and ſeeing the ſaid <hi>Company</hi> are to make them good at 20. s. within ſix moneths, it follows they doe in effect pay intereſt for them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, that although the Uſurer will not accept of theſe Bills but at 19. s. 2. d. yet it doth not follow, that others will not accept of them for commodity, from thoſe of this ingagement at a higher rate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe at this rate, they will (no queſtion) go about, without being ſent in to the ſaid Office, and conſequently the revolution of them, with as much in ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, muſt needs occaſion ſuch great trading to the <hi>Undertakers,</hi> as they may meet with perſons enough, who for their conſtant cuſtome, will be glad to furniſh them with commodity at above
10. d. in the pound cheaper then ordinary; which is all one as to have the full intereſt due upon theſe Bills abated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men expect but 8. <hi>per cent.</hi> when they ſell their ware upon private credit, but would (no doubt) be glad of half that allowance, if the ſecurity were as good as that of the Chamber of London.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that ſell ware upon truſt, cannot alwaies furniſh themſelves with new ware, upon their own credit, and therefore take an allowance of intereſt upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the forbearance of their ſtock: But theſe bills being ſuch as few or none will refuſe, do therein ſupply the place of ready money.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When men have ſold their ware upon truſt, their own eſtates lie at ſtake to pay for the new ware, they procure in ſtead thereof; whereas if they accept of theſe Bills for their ware, they may procure new ware thereupon, and have as full a diſcharge, as if they had paid for the ſame in ready money.</p>
               <p>And if notwithſtanding all this, theſe Bills ſhould not paſſe without a full allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of intereſt, yet aſſuredly in reference to all theſe great advantages, no man but would prefer them much before private credit, which doth abundantly demonſtrate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170618:35"/>the great probability there is, that this <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> being once ſet on foot, would ſuddenly take a good effect; although none of the rules preſcribed in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Section ſhould be obſerved; which was the thing here to be diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For a further anſwer to the aforeſaid Objection, (I ſay) that though this
<hi>Company</hi> were not able to put off theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> at a higher rate then 19
<hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> yet if they refuſe to accept of them for <hi>Commodity,</hi> otherwiſe then at the ſame <hi>rate,</hi> then in caſe they ſhould at this <hi>rate</hi> go about, without being brought into the ſaid <hi>Office;</hi> it follows, that they are not put to make them good in <hi>money,</hi> at any <hi>rate</hi> whatſoever; and conſequently in this caſe, have the uſe of them without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any <hi>intereſt</hi> at all. Now (as I have already proved) it is altogether unlikely, that any number of them ſhould be ſent in to the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> to be made good in <hi>money;</hi> neither (I ſay) do they pay the
<hi>intereſt</hi> of any more, then what are ſo ſent in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſuppoſed in the objection, that the <hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>money</hi> is
8 <hi>per cent.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if theſe <hi>Bills</hi> become current in the place of
<hi>money,</hi> and are proffered to be lent freely unto all that will <hi>borrow</hi> them, it muſt needs follow, that none will give any <hi>conſiderable intereſt</hi> for
<hi>monies,</hi> nay, that by this means the <hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> ſhall ſuddenly fall to nothing.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, men parting (I ſay) with their <hi>ware</hi> upon <hi>private truſt,</hi> at the ſame <hi>rate</hi> of <hi>intereſt</hi> as <hi>money,</hi> ſuppoſe firſt, they ſhould accept of theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> but at the ſame <hi>rate,</hi> that no leſs then the one half of them, were one time with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought in to the ſaid <hi>Office;</hi> and that
<hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>money</hi> did by this means, fall but to half the <hi>rate</hi> as formerly, yet all theſe things put together, this <hi>Company</hi> would not pay above two
<hi>per cent.</hi> for <hi>intereſt,</hi> which muſt needs make <hi>intereſt</hi> (and conſequently ſuch their charge of paying the ſame) fall yet ſo much the more, and ſo perpetually.</p>
               <p>But if it were not poſſible, to avoid the payment of ſome ſmall matter for
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> (yet theſe <hi>Bills</hi> going once about for <hi>Commodity</hi>) both that, and all other charges incident to this Undertaking, yea and much more (if need ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) may be defrayed by the Land purchaſed, upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of theſe
<hi>Bills</hi> in the manner propoſed, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Thus having demonſtrated, that though this <hi>Company</hi> ſhould not ſell
<hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> at an under rate, yet theſe <hi>Bills</hi> would ſuddenly go about without being ſent in to the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> whereby not onely to prevent, either the trouble of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them good in <hi>money,</hi> or the charge of allowing <hi>Intereſt</hi> upon them, but to multiply the <hi>Trading</hi> of thoſe that deal therein, and conſequently to the inabling of them to under-ſell others; and putting them into a capacity of purchaſing Land therewith, it doth thereupon ſufficiently appear, <hi>What great probability there is that this enterprize, being once ſet on foot, would ſuddenly take a good effect, although none of the rules preſcribed in the Section preceding ſhould be obſerved,</hi> which was the thing here to be diſcovered.</p>

               <p>Which are the 24 particulars mentioned in the ſaid Title page.</p>
               <p>Now, I deſire it may be obſerved, that in what hath been here rehearſed, the words of the
<hi>Title page</hi> are expreſſed <hi>Verbatim,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by an <hi>Italick</hi> print, which if read alone by it ſelf, and compared with the ſaid <hi>Title page,</hi> they will be found to agree ſo, as in making good what is affirmed in the ſaid
<hi>Title-page</hi> (as the ſum of all) I ſhall need onely to take the words (thus diſtinguiſhed) in order; And after an explication of my meaning therein, where need requires, ſhall either refer you to thoſe places where the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath been already ſufficiently cleared, or proceed to further proof as there ſhall be need; To which purpoſe, becauſe the end of all writing is to be underſtood, it will be neceſſary to repeate ſometimes in brief, the ſum of what hath been already at large inſiſted on.</p>
               <p>The firſt words therefore in the ſaid <hi>Italick</hi> print, are</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Key of Wealth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, an effectual means, by which the <hi>dore</hi> (or rather a <hi>wide-gate</hi>) is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the <hi>ſtore-houſe</hi> of <hi>Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſtore-houſe,</hi> is the whole <hi>world,</hi> which affords us <hi>riches,</hi> either <hi>by the Fruits of our own Soil, the trade of Fiſhing or Traffick with other Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Key,</hi> is the peoples being in capacity, to beſtow upon themſelves the
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life;</hi> For to give you in brief, the effect of what I have already to this purpoſe obſerved; though the <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> be never ſo full of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,</hi> yet ſeeing the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> cannot afford to take it in, faſter then he can find ſale for what he hath already, it follows, that if the people through their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream poverty, are not able to take it off from the hands of the <hi>Tradeſman,</hi> the dore in that reſpect is ſhut againſt <hi>Trade,</hi> and by conſequence againſt
<hi>Wealth;</hi> For without <hi>Trade,</hi> mens <hi>Wealth</hi> and Eſtates, are ſo far from being increaſed, as they are in a way of decreaſing; and the rather, becauſe by growing daily poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, their <hi>expences</hi> and conſequently their <hi>Trading,</hi> is daily leſs then it was before, to the further increaſe of their <hi>poverty,</hi> and ſo perpetually; ſo that hereby the <hi>Store-houſe of Wealth</hi> is (as it were) locked up againſt ſuch a people.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, let it be ſuppoſed that <hi>money</hi> (or that which goes for ſuch) doth increaſe amongſt them; it followes, that (they not hoarding it up but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out in
<hi>Commodity,</hi> as faſt as they receive it,) the more their hands are filled with ſuch
<hi>money,</hi> by the increaſe thereof, ſo much the more doth the ſale of
<hi>Commodity,</hi> that is <hi>Trading,</hi> increaſe; and this increaſe of <hi>Trading</hi> doth increaſe <hi>Riches,</hi> and that ſo much the faſter; becauſe ſuch <hi>Riches</hi> increaſes mens <hi>expences;</hi> therefore their <hi>Trading,</hi> therefore their
<hi>Riches,</hi> and ſo perpetually; by which means then, you ſee the dore is opened to the Increaſe of <hi>Wealth:</hi> (all which is at large demonſtrated in the 5. firſt Sections of the firſt Book) Therefore increaſe of <hi>money,</hi> or that which goes for ſuch, not hoarded up, is <hi>the Key of Wealth,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170618:37"/>Or,</p>
               <p>The Key of wealth, <hi>or</hi> a new way for Improving of Trade: I make that which tends to the multiplying of trade, to be <hi>the Key</hi> of <hi>Wealth;</hi> for that as without Trade it is impoſſible but a people ſhould grow every day poorer then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; So trading being very quick, it is likewiſe impoſſible but they ſhould grow daily richer, as appeares Lib. 1. Sect. 2.</p>
               <p>A new way,</p>
               <p>If againſt this it be objected, in the words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that <hi>there is nothing</hi> new <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne;</hi> I anſwer, his meaning is that there is no <hi>new matter,</hi> though there be new forms; no <hi>new Genus,</hi> though the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of each kinds may be new.</p>
               <p>As to inſtance, mankind have been from the Creation, yet this or that man never was before, ſo Invention hath been from the Creation, yet this or that Invention as of Printing, &amp;c. never was till of late years; all this is ſo evident, as it cannot be denyed.</p>
               <p>Yet the way of Trading upon Bills, is (I confeſſe) uſed in Flanders, and other parts of the world, though (as I hope I may ſpeak without boaſting or offence) not in neere ſo convenient a manner, as that is which I have here propoſed.</p>
               <p>For Improving of Trade;</p>
               <p>That is, Not onely to recover our decayed Trade to its ordinary meaſure, but to multiply it, to the utmoſt degree that can be needfull, or in juſt reaſon deſireable; as appeares by the precedent part of this Section, and morefully (as is ſaid) by the five firſt <hi>Sections</hi> of the firſt book.</p>
               <p>Lawfull;</p>
               <p>For, as there is nothing (which I know) propoſed, that is any way derogatory to our duty towards God, ſo for our duty towards our Neighbours, I ſhall prove by and by, that this practiſe doth not tend (in the leaſt meaſure) <hi>to prejudice any trade or perſon,</hi> therefore <hi>it is lawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eaſie;</p>
               <p>There being no greater difficulty therein, then in that which is incident to the <hi>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and borrowing of money upon ſecurity: viz.</hi> that he or they who borrow, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure good ſecurity, and he or they who lend, muſt be carefull to ſee that it is good; and that this is all the difficulty attending this enterpriſe: See Lib. 2. Sect. 2. and Lib. 3. Sect. 4.</p>
               <p>Safe;</p>
               <p>The hazard being not ſo great as that which men undergo, when <hi>they take up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in company with others,</hi> wherein each man is bound to make good the whole debt, in caſe his partners faile: when as uſually they take no ſecurity each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make good his own ſhare, much leſſe from a whole <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Inſurers</hi> to run the hazard: Both which in this caſe they do, as appears Lib. 2. Sect. 2. and Lib. 3. Sect. 4. Therefore this courſe is ſafe.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>it is ſafe,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch as whereby men may totally free themſelves from <hi>hazards, (and great ſuits)</hi> incident to deſperate debts, (beſides the loſſe of time by the forbearance of the money) which are the ordinary effects of the uſuall way of dealing upon truſt; and yet have as much trading with ready pay in theſe Bills, as can in reaſon be deſired, Lib. 2. Sect. 3. Therefore <hi>this courſe is far ſafer then the ordinary way of trading.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Effectuall;</p>
               <p>It being ſuch, as I am confident mans reaſon cannot imagine any way without it (or ſomething to the ſame purpoſe) whereby either to <hi>recover our loſt Trade, and inrich the people,</hi> as is evident, Lib. 2. Sect 1. or any ſcruple that may be alledged to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this way doth not tend moſt vigorouſly and effectually to produce the ſame,

               </argument>
               <p>IN proſecution of this, let us take the words expreſſed in the ſaid <hi>Italick</hi> print, in order.</p>
               <p>Shewing how a few Tradeſmen;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tradeſmen;</hi> becauſe they muſt be ſuch as have ware to ſell for theſe Bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A few:</hi> Yea for a need one man alone, being of ſufficient eſtate and credit, may both begin this attempt, and though none joyne with him, continue the ſame: For let that one man have but ſo much credit as to take up ware for ſix moneths, and aſſuredly the giving of a Bill to make good the debt, either in commodity immediately, or in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, within ſix moneths after the demanding thereof, can no whit weaken ſuch his credit, or make it leſſe acceptable; eſpecially if he be cauſed to put in ſufficient ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for making good the termes ſo propoſed, and ſhould procure the ſame to be inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo, by ſuch as are ſufficiently able to pay the debt, in caſe both he and his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould fail ſo to do.</p>
               <p>And if the credit of one man alone would in this caſe be acceptable, how much more that of a whole <hi>Company of ſufficient men bound each for other;</hi> though they were but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10. or
20. in number, amongſt whom though one or two ſhould faile, yet to the whole Company it would not be much conſiderable: Of this ſee more, Lib. 3. Sect. 4. Therefore, I ſay, <hi>a few tradeſmen would ſerve both to begin and continue this practiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, though a few (for a need) would ſerve, yet in caſe the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould joyne therein, the number would not be too many, nor hinder the profit each of other, as I ſhall demonſtrate, when I come to ſhew that <hi>they would notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gain more then ordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170618:38"/>Agreeing together;</p>
               <p>Though their credit may be acceptable, as they are ſo many ſingle perſons, yet their agreeing together as a Company to be bound each for other, muſt needs make ſuch their credit more firm and unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe (in a word as being formerly noted) if one amongſt many faile, the reſt muſt make it good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it puts them upon a neceſſity of taking each from other, ſuch ſecurity, and ſo inſuring that ſecurity, as may (if poſſible) totally free the whole Company, from the leaſt appearance of danger, and much more all others that ſhall deal with them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this credit, Lib. 3. Sect. 4.</p>
               <p>May double their Stocks;</p>
               <p>I do not ſay double their eſtates, but double their ſtocks without paying Intereſt; which clearly intimates a capacity onely of borrowing in money, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as their eſtates and credit can extend to give ſecurity for, Lib. 2. Sect. 1. and Lib. 3. Sect. 4.</p>
               <p>And this, ſeeing it ſhews men the way how by renewing ſuch ſecurity, to continue the borrowing thereof to themſelves and poſterity, even to the end of the world; is upon the matter equivalent to the doubling of their eſtates: For to what purpoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an eſtate better then as a ſtock to be improved?</p>
               <p>The increaſe thereof;</p>
               <p>That is, <hi>if by trading with this doubled ſtock, any one doth increaſe his eſtate, he may upon like ſecurity, have as much more lent him, as whereby to double ſuch increaſe;</hi> the extent of which advantage, is incredible to thoſe who ſhall not read the demonſtration thereof, in Lib. 2. Sect. 3.</p>
               <p>Without paying any Intereſt;</p>
               <p>How the paying of Intereſt may be prevented (or at leaſt defrayed by the rent of the Lands purchaſed with theſe Bills) is ſufficiently demonſtrated, in Lib. 3. Sect. 7.</p>
               <p>Without great difficulty or hazard;</p>
               <p>I have proved in the laſt Section, that the Undertaking is eaſie, therefore without difficulty; ſafe, therefore without hazard; and for a more full demonſtration thereof, ſee Lib. 2. Sect. 2.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe two things of difficulty and hazard, are as I ſaid before, the totall ſumme (as it were) of thoſe Inconveniences, that can with any colour of reaſon be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to counterpoiſe the manifold advantages iſſuing to the Undertakers, (beſides others) from this attempt.</p>
               <p>Without advance of money;</p>
               <p>Great attempts do uſually put men upon vaſt expence of money, before there be any certainty whether their undertaking will prove or no, but here is no ſuch advance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Lib. 2. Sect.
1.</p>
               <p>No danger though the attempt ſhould not take effect, Lib. 3. Sect. 5.</p>
               <p>Nor any queſtion but (being wiſely managed) it will, Lib. 3. Sect. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>It may at the firſt Undertaking, happily coſt ſuch as ſhall profit thereby, ſome ſmall matter out of ſuch their profit, towards the maintaining of an Office, which yet will not be requir'd of any, who ſhall upon their oaths teſtific, that they have not gotten more then ſeven times as much thereby.</p>
               <p>Yet if this practiſe be continued, this charge (as I ſaid before) will be much more then recompenced by the rent of the Lands, purchaſed upon the credit of theſe Bills; neither is this any advance of money, ſeeing it is onely required of thoſe, that after proceeding therein, have profited thereby; ſo as being onely out of the cleare profit by this means occaſioned, it cannot properly be called a charge, much leſſe an advance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170618:39"/>of money; though the gains of this undertaking be thereby ſome ſmall matter the leſſe: Therefore <hi>this enterpriſe may be attempted and proſecuted without advance of money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without prejudice to any trade or perſon;</p>
               <p>When that rare invention of Printing began firſt to be practiſed, how exceedingly was it oppoſed, and that with ſome ſhew of reaſon; being alledged that it tended to deprive a conſiderable number of the race of mankind, of their daily bread; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at that time had no other way to live, but by the uſe of their pen, in writing thoſe books which ſince are uſed to be printed.</p>
               <p>Whereas in reference to this enterpriſe, it is moſt apparent, that the unqueſtionable conſequence of it is, not to leſſen, but to multiply imployment upon men of all trades and callings, (except <hi>Uſurers, Brokers</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi>) and that in ſuch ſort, as neither any trade, nor yet any particular perſon can be (in the leaſt meaſure) prejudiced thereby.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe it tends to the leſſening (if not annihilating) of Intereſt, and to remove oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for <hi>pawning of goods,</hi> or <hi>ſuits in Law:</hi> Neither need I diſpute whether the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, much leſſe the <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of <hi>Vſurers, Brokers,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> be lawfull or not; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is undeniable, that if there be any means whereby a people may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, with a ſufficient quantity of money, (or that which goes for ſuch) without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt for it, and ſo as they ſhall not need to
<hi>pawn their cloaths for food;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe matters ſo ordered, as <hi>Law ſuits may be prevented;</hi> In this caſe, though both <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Brokers</hi> &amp; <hi>Lawyers</hi> loſe their cuſtomers, not any one of them can juſtly complain of prejudice.</p>
               <p>For I muſt confeſſe, that if the practiſe of any thing may be truly called a prejudice to any one perſon, then though the conſequence thereof were otherwiſe never ſo good, it were not lawfull to be done; ſeeing it would be the ſame (at the beſt) as to doe a ſmall evill, that a great good might come of it: but for a people to uſe means to inrich themſelves, and that in a way as may be moſt free from occaſioning <hi>ſuits of Law,</hi> can by no means be denied to be lawfull, though both <hi>Vſurers, Brokers,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> loſe all their cuſtomers thereby.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing it is beyond all controverſie lawfull, therefore it can be no more a prejudice to any, then the doing of juſt things can properly be called prejudiciall, which would imply a contradiction: Conſequently this practiſe <hi>doth not tend to the juſt prejudice of any trade or perſon,</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>Without incurring any other Inconvenience;</p>
               <p>A Negative is hard to be proved, but this I ſay, that other Inconveniences then what are already mentioned, I cannot imagine any.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewed, how and where it is demonſtrated, <hi>that a few Tradeſmen agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, may both double their Stocks, and the increaſe thereof,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Multiply their returns,</p>
               <p>I ſay the returnes, both of themſelves and all thoſe that hang out the ſaid <hi>Flag; even to the utmoſt degree, that they are all poſſibly able to manage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if theſe <hi>Bills</hi> be currant but amongſt a <hi>few,</hi> the <hi>takings</hi> (that is the <hi>trading</hi>) of thoſe <hi>few</hi> will be ſo much the more Lib. 2. Sect. 4. if they be currant amongſt <hi>many</hi> then the number of ſuch <hi>Bills</hi> may be multiplyed proportionably; by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing <hi>Land</hi> with them, and lending them Gratis upon ſuch <hi>ſecurity</hi> as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned, yea untill they have increaſed the
<hi>number of them,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence their <hi>takings</hi> according to their deſires Lib. 2. Sect. 1. &amp; Lib. 3. Sect. 4.</p>
               <p>For it followes, by what hath been already demonſtrated Lib. 1. Sect. 4. that the more of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> be ſtirring, the more will the <hi>takings</hi> be, of thoſe that hang out the ſaid <hi>Flag;</hi> it is alſo manifeſt by what hath been declared Lib. 2. Sect. 3. that by this means, theſe <hi>Bills</hi> may be multiplyed to the utmoſt quantity that can be needfull, for increaſing their <hi>trading to the greateſt meaſure, that they are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly able to manage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, I may ſafely conclude, that it is in the power of thoſe of this
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi> to multiply the <hi>trading</hi> both of themſelves and of all thoſe that hang out the ſaid <hi>Flag,</hi> and that <hi>to the utmost degree that they are poſſibly able to manage;</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>May deale onely for ready pay,</p>
               <p>That is they may if they pleaſe, have (I ſay) as much trading as they are able to manage, and yet <hi>deale onely for ready pay;</hi> I do not ſay <hi>ready money,</hi> but <hi>ready pay,</hi> either in <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This followes from what was laſt demonſtrated, where it was made to appear, that if it was in their power, to order matters ſo, as to have as much <hi>trading as they could poſſibly manage;</hi> yet it is manifeſt that it was no otherwiſe then either in <hi>money</hi> or theſe <hi>Bills;</hi> that is, <hi>in ready pay;</hi> and conſequently may (without prejudice) refuſe to deale any otherwiſe then for ſuch <hi>ready pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much underſell others,</p>
               <p>That is, they may affoard (if they pleaſe) to <hi>ſell cheaper</hi> then others of the ſame trade can <hi>buy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their Quickneſſe of <hi>trading</hi> will occaſion their buying <hi>much Commodity at once,</hi> their buying <hi>much at once</hi> will inable them (as it doth
<hi>whole-ſale-men</hi>) <hi>to buy it cheaper</hi> by one or two ſhillings on the pound then other men can and their <hi>Quick returnes</hi> will inable them to live by much leſſe
<hi>Profit</hi> then others; ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170618:40"/>as <hi>buying</hi> their <hi>Commodities</hi> above 12 d. in the pound
<hi>cheaper</hi> then others, they may through ſuch quick <hi>returnes</hi> live better upon
<hi>that</hi> 12 <hi>d. Profit,</hi> then thoſe others can do though they <hi>gaine</hi> 5
<hi>s.</hi> on the pound upon all the <hi>Ware</hi> they ſell; All which is more fully demonſtrated Lib. 1. Sect. 7. Therefore <hi>they may (if they pleaſe) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard to ſell Cheaper then others of the ſame Trade can buy;</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhould accompt this a prejudice to himſelf, what hinders but he may take the ſame courſe; or elſe ſhew a reaſon why he cannot juſtly do ſo, which if he can, I ſhall then think it my duty to join with him, in an indeavour to prevent all others that ſhould attempt the practice thereof; In the mean time if men complain of <hi>Prejudice,</hi> when the
<hi>mendes</hi> (as they ſay) is in their own hands, (whereby (meerly) to hinder others from doing that, which tends to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of themſelves and the whole nation,) <hi>God</hi> and the whole <hi>World</hi> will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes againſt them.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, that a <hi>fall</hi> in the price of <hi>Commodities</hi> (which upon this, muſt needs follow) is a <hi>Prejudice</hi> to a Nation; I anſwer, not except it occaſion a <hi>fall</hi> in the price of their own <hi>Commodities</hi> in <hi>Forreigne parts,</hi> whereby to prevent the <hi>importing of Bullion,</hi> as doth appear more fully where that particular is handled, to which I referre.</p>
               <p>May put the whole Nation upon this practice,</p>
               <p>That is, they may by this meanes ſuddainly, both <hi>neceſſitate</hi> and
<hi>incourage</hi> all Tradeſ-men in the Land to follow this practice; <hi>viz.</hi> if not to borrow of theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> yet at leaſt to hang out the ſaid <hi>Flag,</hi> whereby to declare themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay <hi>neceſſitate:</hi> For ſeeing few or none will buy <hi>Commodity</hi> but of thoſe that are apparently known <hi>to affoard much the better penyworths;</hi> it muſt follow that all thoſe who will not take this courſe, whereby they may be able to ſell their
<hi>Ware</hi> as cheape as others; will ſuddainly looſe their <hi>Cuſtomers:</hi> ſo as all the trading being hereby as it were <hi>ingroſſed,</hi> by thoſe that have put out the ſaid
<hi>Flag,</hi> they will be yet ſo much the better (if it were poſſible) inabled <hi>to underſell others,</hi> and others ſo much the more neceſſitated for their meer preſervation to hang out the ſame <hi>Flag,</hi> whereby they may be in capacity to enjoy ſome <hi>Trading</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Incouraged:</hi> for ſo long as there is neither <hi>hazard, charge nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in hanging out the ſaid <hi>Flag</hi> or <hi>taking</hi> the ſaid <hi>Bills;</hi> and yet the Advantage by multiplying mens <hi>trading</hi> to the utmoſt degree poſſible, is ſo exceeding great beſides the removing of thoſe many <hi>hazards</hi> and delaies for want of ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that are Incident to the ordinary way of dealing on <hi>Credit,</hi> theſe things muſt needs (to all rationall men,) be ſuch ſtrong <hi>incouragements,</hi> as arguments taken from <hi>neceſſity,</hi> will no doubt to them be ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>thoſe that practice this courſe, may thereby ſuddainly both neceſſitate and Incourage all Tradeſ-men in the Land to do the like;</hi> which was the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>May gain notwithſtanding more then ordinary,</p>
               <p>That is, though all the <hi>Tradeſ-men</hi> in the Land ſhould joine in this practice, yet they may notwithſtanding (if they pleaſe) order matters ſo, as whereby to have one with another, <hi>as much</hi> trading <hi>as they are poſſibly able to manage,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may gaine notwithſtanding more then ordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:170618:41"/>For though all the Tradeſ-men in the Nation, ſhould at once join in this
<hi>Practice;</hi> yet by the <hi>free loane</hi> of thoſe <hi>Bills</hi> and by purchaſing
<hi>Land</hi> with them (morgaging that land to make them good) thoſe Bills might (I ſay) be multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, as to be equal to what mens <hi>eſtates</hi> are otherwiſe worth, though never ſo much increaſed by ſuch quick trading; which will amount to a ſum at leaſt
<hi>ten times</hi> greater then all the <hi>money</hi> in the Land; and conſequently make their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one with another <hi>one hundred times</hi> greater then now it is (as is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lib 1. Sect. 4.) <hi>if men were poſſibly able to manage it;</hi> therefore what was to be proved doth follow.</p>
               <p>May deſiſt when they pleaſe without damage,</p>
               <p>That is, not onely thoſe who onely hang out the ſaid <hi>Flag,</hi> may after ſome tryall of the conſequence thereof, take it in again if they ſee cauſe, <hi>without dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> either to themſelves or any others; but even the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers</hi> themſelves, (if they be willing ſo to do,) may by repayment of the totall ſumme of the <hi>Bills</hi> thus borrowed; viz. By delivering in, all the <hi>Bills</hi> they have in their own hands to the ſaid
<hi>Office;</hi> and a ſumme in money equal to the totall ſumme of the <hi>Bills</hi> diſperſed in the hands of others, I ſay by this meanes they may deſiſt when they pleaſe from this practice <hi>without damage to themſelves or others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whereas according to what was noted before, moſt <hi>undertakings</hi> that ſeem to promiſe any conſiderable advantage, are of that nature as requiring a <hi>disburſement</hi> of great ſummes of <hi>money</hi> from thoſe who attempt the ſame, do thereby neceſſitate ſuch as would <hi>deſist</hi> from further purſuing ſuch <hi>attempt,</hi> to loſe all the money ſo diſburſed; yet this deſign requiring no ſuch diſburſement, but being carryed on by a <hi>borrowed Stock,</hi> may at any time be layed down, by <hi>repayment</hi> of the Stock ſo <hi>borrowed,</hi> ſeeing that to lay down the practice of this enterpriſe, is no more I ſay then to pay the debt due upon thoſe <hi>Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſidering therefore that for men to pay their <hi>Debts</hi> cannot be a damage to themſelves, (and much leſſe to others) it may truely be ſaid, that thoſe who attempt this Practice, <hi>may deſist when they pleaſe without damage;</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>

               <p>That is, as neceſſarily as naturall cauſes, to produce their proper effects; which appears by the ſequell.</p>
               <p>Much,</p>
               <p>That is, Many of the aforeſaid 24 particulars; unto the utmoſt extent that in reaſon may be wiſhed or permitted; and the reſt in very great meaſure; as will be clear by what followes.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Firſt, To Inrich the people of this Land.</head>
                  <p>That is, to put the Generality of the people into a capacity of beſtowing comfortable maintenance upon themſelves and Families, reliefe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent poor, entertainment of Friends, Journeys for recreation, Phyſick and

                  <p>By beſtowing <hi>as much</hi> (upon the comfortable maintenance of themſelves &amp;c.)
<hi>as can in reaſon be wiſhed;</hi> I mean, either <hi>as much</hi> as they would though they were <hi>one hundred times</hi> richer then they are; or at leaſt <hi>as much</hi> as from year to year can be procured for <hi>money</hi> and the beſt <hi>Credit,</hi> either out of <hi>the fruits of our own ſoil, the trade of fiſhing or traffick with other Nations:</hi> for al this muſt needs be the conſequence of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> when in creaſed to the
<hi>uttermost,</hi> the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this <hi>enterpriſe</hi> doth diſcover, as is proved Lib. 1. Sect. 4. &amp; Lib. 4. Sect. 1.</p>
                  <p>If it be queſtioned, whether the utmoſt improvement of <hi>our own ſoil, the trade of fiſhing and traffick with other Nations</hi> would yield every year ſo great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Commodity as might in reaſon be wiſhed?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, If the Tradeſ-men cannot with <hi>money</hi> and the beſt <hi>Credit,</hi> viz.
<hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pay</hi> in the aforeſaid <hi>Bills</hi> procure commodity, ſo faſt as by reaſon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant riches of the people, they ſpend yearly upon themſelves, it argues that his trading is ſuch as <hi>Commodities</hi> go off his hands faſter then he <hi>is able with ſuch ready pay to procure them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if it were once come to that paſſe, that men could ſell their <hi>Commodities,</hi> and that for ready pay, as faſt as by their utmoſt induſtry they were poſſibly <hi>able to procure them;</hi> it can ſcarce be eſtimated, either how much ſuch <hi>ready pay</hi> would incourage <hi>Induſtry,</hi> or how much ſuch <hi>Induſtry,</hi> with ſuch <hi>quick returnes,</hi> would increaſe mens <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>ſtock</hi> in abundant plenty of
<hi>Commodity;</hi> by making the Land wherein they live (though the ſoil were never ſo barren,) a kind of <hi>Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> or <hi>Ware-houſe</hi> to the whole world; ſeeing that if men could find ſale for <hi>one hundred times</hi> as much <hi>ware</hi> in the moneth as formerly, it is not to be believed that they would fail to ſtore themſelves proportionably, in caſe the <hi>whole world</hi> could but be made (by the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> of men) to affoard it.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoſe it will be needfull to note what I have once obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; viz. That if there be but ſale for <hi>Commodity</hi> in any place <hi>acceſſible,</hi> all the
<hi>Merchants</hi> throughout the <hi>world</hi> would be ſure to ſend it thither in as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions as could be needfull; whereby ſuch place though never ſo barren of it ſelf, being (as it were) the <hi>ſeate of trade,</hi> might become as full of <hi>commodity</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reſt of the <hi>world,</hi> as <hi>London</hi> is to other parts of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollan.</hi> have put this truth out of queſtion, by their own experience whoſe
<hi>Land,</hi> though ſo barren as it yields in a manner nothing; yet it being their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice to hearken unto all <hi>Propoſals, incourage</hi> ſuch as are good, and <hi>ſet on foot</hi> all that tends to the advance of <hi>trade, Induſtry and riches</hi> (as conducing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other advantages to the increaſe of <hi>Cuſtome, exciſe &amp;c.</hi>) and in all theſe things to uſe <hi>diſpatch;</hi> they have almoſt <hi>ingroſſed</hi> all trading into their own <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,</hi> and notwithſtanding ſuch <hi>Barrenneſſe</hi> of their
<hi>own ſoil,</hi> are as it were the <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> for <hi>plenty of Commodity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which (by the way) that they ſhould ſo much exceed, (nay that they ſhould come neer unto) us, (in regard of the great <hi>fruit fulneſſe</hi> of this Land in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theirs) what reaſon (ſeeing they have bin exerciſed with <hi>War</hi> much longer then we) can be given, but our want of Induſtry and <hi>watchfulneſſe</hi> to take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for <hi>advance of trade</hi> amongſt us?</p>
                  <p>And this doth indeed demonſtrate, that we in England are (as one ſaith) like thoſe prodigall <hi>ſpendthrifts,</hi> who being <hi>Heirs</hi> to a reaſonable eſtate; waſte and conſume their ſuſtance for want of good <hi>huſbandry,</hi> till they reduce themſelves to extream want; whereas they in <hi>Holland</hi> like thoſe young beginners that have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170618:42"/>little or no <hi>Stock,</hi> nor any <hi>friends</hi> to depend upon, do ſo ſeriouſly apply their mindes to all the <hi>methodes of thriving,</hi> as they quickly become exceeding rich.</p>
                  <p>Wherein ſeeing it cannot be denyed, but that the many ſad effects of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, who <hi>periſh for want;</hi> will leave without excuſe, ſuch as ſhall neglect (in their places and calling) to huſband <hi>natures liberall giftes</hi> to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (when an eaſie <hi>meanes</hi> thereunto is diſcovered) I hope the fear of <hi>God,</hi> will prevent all thoſe whom it concerns, from ſinning ſo much againſt the light of <hi>nature,</hi> as to neglect in any meaſure poſſible, the furtherance of that <hi>meanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return from whence we have digreſſed; as to the fruitfulnes of our <hi>native ſoil;</hi> it is well known, that before our late <hi>troubles,</hi> this Land did affoard us
<hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> enough; that there is like to be much of it far better <hi>improved,</hi> both by the <hi>ſale</hi> of that which hath not been plowed up for theſe many generations (if ever at all;) And by many excellent waies lately diſcovered for <hi>improvement of Land,</hi> againſt the practiſe whereof there is no greater diſcouragement then that of <hi>a high rate of intereſt,</hi> (as hath been long ſince demonſtrated by thoſe who have writ of that ſubject) which by meanes of this <hi>enterpriſe</hi> will be exceedingly
<hi>leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened,</hi> if not <hi>annihilated,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew in its place: To which purpoſe if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire further ſatisfaction concerning the improvement of Land; I refer them to a Book put forth by <hi>Captain Walt. Blith</hi> called the Engliſh improver; and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſecond edition thereof which I am informed (being now coming forth) will preſent the world with many excellent diſcoveries never before obſerved: I would adviſe thoſe who are concerned therein to ſpeak with the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who if he be able, as I hope he is, to give a rational account of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings to thoſe that ſhal converſe with him: it cannot but give much ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>His lodging I believe, may be found by inquiring of him that prints his Book. Thus much I thought good to intimate, not for any ſkill I have to judge of this Authors Works; but out of a deſire that all things tending to publique good, might be inquired out and furthered here, as much as they are in other parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Land, ſo no doubt the <hi>Sea,</hi> would be as helpfull to us, as it is to the
<hi>Hollander;</hi> through the <hi>Trade of fiſhing</hi> which is of no ſmall importance, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many ſeverall <hi>trades</hi> that depend thereon: the much imployment for the
<hi>Poor</hi> that it would occaſion, &amp; the <hi>great</hi> increaſe of victual which will by that meanes be produced; whereby not onely <hi>Fiſh</hi> but <hi>Fleſh</hi> would <hi>fall in price:</hi> For elſe the <hi>generality</hi> of the people might, (and eſpecially the
<hi>Poor</hi> would) feed ſo much the more upon <hi>Fiſh,</hi> till the price of
<hi>Fleſh</hi> did thereby fall conſiderably.</p>
                  <p>Adde to all this that the <hi>number of perſons</hi> amonſt us, are (though a thing much to be lamented) exceedingly leſſened, by the abundance of Bloud that hath bin ſo unhappily ſpilt in theſe late wars, beſides the multitudes that by reaſon of the <hi>new Plantations,</hi> and eſpecially by reaſon of our <hi>late troubles,</hi> have forſaken this their <hi>Native ſoil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſay in all theſe reſpects it muſt needs be granted, that <hi>though the People of this Land were generally rich, whereby they might beſtow upon themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies a comfortable maintenance; yet this fruit full Land, by the helpe of the Sea through the trade of Fiſhing and traffick with other Nations, would affoard from time to time a store as much as at each time would be needfull, or in reaſon deſireable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And conſequently that by the uſe of the aforeſaid <hi>Bils,</hi> in a way of
<hi>Trade,</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may be increaſed, and by conſequence <hi>riches,</hi> and that ſo as whereby, <hi>to put the generality of the people into a capacity of beſtowing upon them comfortable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of themſelves and families, reliefe of Indigent poor, entertainment of Friends,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170618:43"/>Journeys for recreation, Phyſick and attendance when ſick, and ſuch like; as much as can in reaſon be wiſhed, and yet be in capacity to lay up plentifull proportions for their poſterities beſides,</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>

                  <head>Secondly, To diſperſe the money hoarded up,</head>
                  <p>The aforeſaid <hi>Bills</hi> not paſſing about but with <hi>halfe money,</hi> (in caſe there be money enough in the Land to <hi>double</hi> them, otherwiſe not but with a convenient
<hi>proportion of money;</hi>) muſt needs by the revolution of them, draw forth all the
<hi>money</hi> in the Land, to as quick a current through the hands of Tradeſ-men as the

                  <p>Whereas whatſoever tendeth to the quickning of <hi>Trade,</hi> producing (for the ſame reaſon,) the contrary effect, it followes that this <hi>enterprize</hi> tendeth in both the aforeſaid reſpects <hi>to diſperſe the money hoarded up.</hi>

                  <p>I ſay cheaper, by which I meane, when the <hi>Forreign Coine</hi> that ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities do poſt our Merchants beyond-Sea, is of <hi>greater value</hi> (weight and fineneſſe conſidered) then the price in <hi>Engliſh coyn,</hi> which thoſe <hi>Forreign Commodities</hi> will yield here, whereby ſuch <hi>Forreign Coine</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> (being brought hither) would yield more in <hi>Engliſh money</hi> (being coined at the Tower) then ſuch <hi>Forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie</hi> it ſelfe; ſo as they who ſhould returne ſuch
<hi>coine</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> without laying it out in ſuch commodity, would gain more then by the return of ſuch <hi>commoditie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from hence it muſt needs follow, that Merchants would uſe all meanes poſſible <hi>to Import Bullion</hi> rather then any ſuch <hi>Commodity;</hi> Therefore if <hi>by means of this enterpriſe, it ſhall come to paſſe, that Forreign Commodities will be cheaper here in England, then in the places from whence they are brought</hi> (as I ſhall prove in its place) it cannot be denyed that this <hi>enterpriſe</hi> doth tend <hi>much, to cauſe bullion to be imported from beyond-Sea,</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>Obj. But if <hi>Engliſh Commoditys</hi> fall in price as well as <hi>Forreign,</hi> Merchants would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170618:43"/>ſell our Engliſh <hi>Commodities</hi> at ſo much the lower rate beyond-Sea, which would by the ſame reaſon, occaſion <hi>monies to be exported.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though <hi>Engliſh commodities</hi> ſhould here fall in price never ſo much, if <hi>Forreign commoditys</hi> fall here alſo, it doth not follow that Merchants could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard to ſell our <hi>Engliſh Commodities</hi> ever the cheaper <hi>beyond-ſea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe, both <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>domeſtick Commodities,</hi> were but <hi>the twentieth part</hi> of the rate here as in other places; yet if in this caſe Merchants ſhould ſell our <hi>Commodities</hi> beyond-ſea; at neer <hi>the twentieth part</hi> of the rate as formerly, then ſeeing (beyond-ſea) they muſt pay as much as ever for their <hi>Forreign commoditys,</hi> and ſel them here but at <hi>the twentieth</hi> part of the rate as formerly, they would loſe about <hi>nineteen parts of twenty</hi> by the whole return.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the other ſide, if they gain 20 <hi>s. for</hi> 12. <hi>d.</hi> by the Commodities
<hi>exported,</hi> then though by the cheapeneſſe of Forreign Commodities here, they loſe 18 s 6 d. <hi>per l.</hi> by <hi>Importing</hi> of them, yet they gain 50. <hi>per</hi> 100. by the
<hi>whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi> and would in this caſe, gain no leſſe then 20 <hi>s. for</hi> 12
<hi>d.</hi> if they ſhould return the <hi>Forreign coin</hi> it ſelf, without buying any ſuch
<hi>commodity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is clear then, that though <hi>domeſtick</hi> as well as <hi>Forreign commodities,</hi> do fall in price here in England; yet Merchants cannot affoard to ſell our <hi>Engliſh commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi> ever the cheaper beyond-ſea, ſo long as <hi>Forreign commodities</hi> continues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea, at the ſame rate as formerly; becauſe by paying dearer beyond-ſea, for thoſe <hi>Forreign commodities</hi> then they ſell them for here, they ſuſtain a
<hi>loſſe,</hi> which they muſt make up with ſome <hi>profit</hi> upon the <hi>whole return,</hi> by ſelling our <hi>Engliſh Commodities</hi> there, as deer as ever. And for the further clearing of this myſtery take one more inſtance: ſuppoſe they loſe <hi>tenpounds in the hundred</hi> by the Commodities <hi>imported,</hi> then though they gain <hi>thirty in the hundred</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities <hi>exported,</hi> yet by the <hi>whole return</hi> they gain clear but <hi>twenty pounds in the hundred;</hi> whereas I ſay again, if they could return the
<hi>Forreign coin or Bullion,</hi> they would ſave the ſaid loſſe of <hi>ten pounds in the hundred,</hi> and conſequently gain <hi>a thirty in the hundred</hi> by the <hi>whole return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be objected again, that in this caſe, men would <hi>Import</hi> no other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but
<hi>Bullion,</hi> becauſe it would be moſt <hi>profitable</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this Nation doth ſcarce ſtand in need of any <hi>Forreign Commoditie</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Sugar;</hi> yet if our Merchants cannot procure their return in <hi>Bullion,</hi> they muſt return other Commodities whether they will or no; for other States, uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their beſt endeavor to prevent the exporting <hi>of Bullion,</hi> Merchants cannot with ſafety make (frequently) their returns therein.</p>
                  <p>If it be queſtioned, whether theſe <hi>Bills</hi> ſerving in the place of <hi>money,</hi> would not occaſion that money being in this reſpect of leſſe neceſſity, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; that <hi>money</hi> (I confeſſe in this caſe) would not be ſo neceſſary, nay if we had not one dram of <hi>money</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> in the Land, yet having a ſufficient quantity of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> amongſt us, I do not ſee what conſiderable inconvenience could follow in any reſpect whatſoever; for whether a Nation have any
<hi>Silven</hi> amongſt them or no, yet if they can <hi>Trade</hi> as well without it, what need they care? for their eſtates in <hi>Vendible Commodities,</hi> (and conſequently their
<hi>Credit</hi>) is of as reall value as if it were in <hi>money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be replyed, that <hi>money</hi> would be neceſſary for the <hi>retale</hi> of commodities, payment of <hi>Souldiers</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this might (for a need, as I have already in effect intimated) be done by theſe
<hi>Bills</hi> without <hi>money;</hi> yet rather then want <hi>money</hi> for ſuch an occaſion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170618:44"/>I will not ſay we might coin <hi>Farthings</hi> and <hi>half-pence</hi> that ſhould be worth in ſine <hi>copper</hi> about the value they are taken for; But we might purchaſe <hi>Bullion</hi> with ſome of our <hi>commodities;</hi> a law being made that Merchants ſhall make, at leaſt the <hi>twelſth part</hi> of their returnes in
<hi>Bullion;</hi> which would inrich the Nation, more then ſuch ſlight and Tall
<hi>Commodities</hi> as are uſually returned at deer rates, in ſtead of thoſe many and excellent <hi>Merchandiſes</hi> that this Nation yields.</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer again; that though in this caſe <hi>money</hi> would not be ſo neceſſary as formerly, yet that would be no motive at all unto the exporting of our <hi>coin;</hi> for it is well known, that particular perſons in their dealings in a way of <hi>Trade,</hi> do not looke ſo much at what is moſt <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the Common-wealth, as what is moſt
<hi>Profitable</hi> for themſelves, now certain I am, that as the multiplying of theſe
<hi>Bills</hi> amongſt us (according to what is already proved) would in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect make the
<hi>importing of Bullion,</hi> more <hi>profitable</hi> then any other commodity; ſo it is clear, that upon no conſideration whatſoever, it can make the <hi>exporting of coine</hi> more
<hi>profitable</hi> to them, then otherwiſe it would be.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid that it may make <hi>money</hi> and <hi>Bills</hi> ſo plentiful here, as in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where <hi>money</hi> is ſcarce, men will give <hi>higher rates</hi> for it, and conſequently, it will be exported to thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the <hi>ſcarcity</hi> of <hi>money</hi> in thoſe other parts, cannot proceed from our <hi>plenty</hi> of <hi>Bills</hi> in England.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they muſt give ſuch <hi>higher rates</hi> either in <hi>money,</hi> in
<hi>commoditie,</hi> or in <hi>exchange</hi> by Bills of exchange; if in <hi>money,</hi> then they loſe more <hi>Bullion</hi> then they gain by the bargain; if in <hi>Commodities,</hi> that is no otherwiſe, but to ſell their <hi>commodities</hi> ſo much the <hi>cheaper,</hi> upon condition they may have their returnes made them in mony, and not otherwiſe; and why, if
<hi>money</hi> be <hi>ſcarce</hi> here, may not we in <hi>England</hi> take the ſame courſe, much rather then any other <hi>Nation,</hi> having in our own hands, all <hi>Commodities</hi> that are meerly neceſſary for mans ſubſiſtance? And thirdly, <hi>if in exchange by Bills of exchange</hi> (if <hi>I</hi> ſay in this) they give a higer rate for our coine then formerly, it will be the occaſion of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their coine</hi> hither, and not of <hi>exporting ours</hi> to other parts.</p>
                  <p>As to inſtance, if any Nation do give for any ſum in <hi>Engliſh coin,</hi> a ſum of greater value in their <hi>own coin;</hi> it followes, that they who having ſuch ſum in
<hi>Forreign coin</hi> due to them, ſhould receive it by <hi>exchange in Engliſh coin</hi> they ſhould thereby receive a ſum of <hi>leſſe value,</hi> then that which was due unto them in
<hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign coin;</hi> and therefore, (aiming at their own profit) would indeavor to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch Forreign coin</hi> hither, and not to receive it by ſuch exchange in <hi>Engliſh coin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all this then you ſee it is not with money, as it is with commodity, that the
<hi>ſcarcer</hi> and (by conſequence) the <hi>deerer</hi> it is in any <hi>place,</hi> the more like it is to be ſent into that <hi>place;</hi> but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be yet further objected, that ſuch <hi>increaſe of Bills</hi> amongſt us, may occaſion Forreign Nations to <hi>enhance</hi> their own <hi>coin,</hi> and by conſequence, to <hi>undervalue</hi> ours; whereby it ſhould follow, that a Merchant having an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds due to him here in <hi>Engliſh coine,</hi> cannot get ſo much in <hi>value,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned beyond-ſea in <hi>Foorreign coin,</hi> ſo as if he could export his 100 l. <hi>Engliſh coin,</hi> it would yield him more beyond-ſea, then by <hi>Bill of exchange</hi> he can get there paid him in <hi>Forreign coin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the encreaſing of theſe Bills amongſt us here in England, can be no motive to other Nations to <hi>enhance</hi> their money; they being every whit as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170618:44"/>like to do this, whether we take any ſuch courſe of trading with theſe
<hi>Bills,</hi> or no; which yet if they ſhould, it would do us ſo much the more
<hi>prejudice,</hi> by how much the greater a <hi>damage</hi> it will be to this Nation to have their <hi>moneys exported,</hi> when they have no other meanes to maintain Trade amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Yet in a word, and ſo to paſſe from this, why may not we <hi>Inhance</hi> our monis (in order to <hi>exchanges</hi> abroad, though not to rents and <hi>debts</hi> amongſt our ſelves) as well as other Nations doe theirs? and why ſhould not we be as carefull of our own preſervation, as the very <hi>Perſians, Turkes &amp;c?</hi> by applying our ſelves to the uſe of ſome effectuall meanes, whereby the price of our <hi>exchanges</hi> may be ſo high, as to occaſion that no Merchants ſhall return their moneys, by <hi>exchange</hi> without great loſſe; ſo as then having no Trade amongſt us by <hi>exchange for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> with other Nations, but meerly by <hi>Importing</hi> of <hi>moneys</hi> or <hi>commodities,</hi> and that of
<hi>moneys</hi> being (by meanes of this enterpriſe) made moſt profitable of the two, this
<hi>undertaking</hi> ſhall, (in this reſpect) tend to much the more, <hi>to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of Bullion from beyond-ſea</hi> according to what was here to be proved.</p>

                     <hi>Commoditie</hi> ſupplies the place of <hi>money,</hi> two waies; either when by reaſon of an extraordinary <hi>quickneſſe of trading,</hi> it is (as they ſay) every mans money; and becomes ſo <hi>Vendible,</hi> as men could not loſe to take it for money it ſelf, at the rate of the Market; and this is no more then the effect of trade, when quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the utmoſt period-Secondly, <hi>Commodity</hi> ſupplyeth the place of money, when money (or that which goes for ſuch) is ſo plentiful as any man that hath <hi>commodity,</hi> and conſequently
<hi>Credit,</hi> may upon morgaging thereof, borrow ſuch money without paying Intereſt, and ſo may obtain <hi>new ware,</hi> and yet keep the <hi>old commodity</hi> (which gives him this
<hi>Credit</hi>) ſtill in his cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>Now, both theſe are the undeniable effects of this enterpriſe, and being put together, do like <hi>two</hi> fummes not <hi>added,</hi> but <hi>multiplyed</hi> each by other, produce a
<hi>third,</hi> much greater then the totall of both: For the more <hi>ſaleable</hi> commodity is, the better <hi>ſecurity</hi> it is for borrowing money thereupon; and the better
<hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> it is the leſſe are men conſtrained to underſell it, for procuring ſuch <hi>money,</hi> and conſequently the more <hi>ſaleable</hi> it is; hence it is yet ſo much the better <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> therefore alſo yet ſo much the more ſaleable, and ſo
<hi>ad infinitum;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, (I ſay) theſe two advantages being put together, do tend to

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, whereas I here ſpeake of <hi>Commodities</hi> being <hi>ſecurity</hi> for the borrowing of <hi>money,</hi> (by which <hi>money</hi> I mean the aforeſaid <hi>Bills</hi>) yet I would not have it to be underſtood, as if the <hi>Company</hi> before mentioned, ſhould ordinarily accept of <hi>Commodity</hi> for their <hi>ſecurity;</hi> but my meaning is, that thoſe who have an

                  <p>But further, according to the words of Mr. Robinſon before cited, the <hi>greater trade of one country, hath a capacity of undermining and eating out, the leſſer Trades of other countryes,</hi> that is, by buying cheaper and ſelling for leſſe profit; And ſo ſelling the ſame commodities as cheap perhaps, as other Nations can buy them, it muſt needs tend to Ingroſſe all the Trade into their own hands; as the Hollander hath by this meanes done by the

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if the price of Commoditys fall never ſo much in England, yet ſuch fall doth not hinder a further fall: for though, (as is already noted) both <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>domeſtick Commodities,</hi> ſhould fall till thoſe things which are now ſold at 20 s. may be had for
12. d. yet ſeeing he that receives this 12. d. can procure as much new Commodity therewith, as formerly with his 20. s. it muſt needs come to paſſe, that by the ſame reaſon as Commodities fell to this low rate, they may fall ſtill more and more perpetually.</p>
                  <p>Further, in caſe Merchants (who export our Engliſh Commodities) ſhould purchaſe them here at the twentieth part of the rate as formerly, then (though by ſuch a fall in the price of Commodities in England, <hi>Forreign</hi> as well as <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Commodities</hi> be ſold at the twentieth part of the rate as formerly, yet) they may affoard to ſell their <hi>Forreign Commodities</hi> alſo at the twentieth part of the rate as formerly, and ſtill gain as much per l. as ever, by the whole return.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, that which occaſions in England, a conſiderable fall in the price of Commodities in Generall, muſt needs occaſion a fall in the price as well of <hi>Forreign</hi> as of <hi>Engliſh Commodities,</hi> although they ſhould come to that low rate, as to be ſold cheaper in England then they were bought beyond-ſea; and from hence follows one thing, that in the particulars touching the importing of Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was taken for granted; viz. <hi>That this enterpriſe tendeth to occaſion Forreign Commodities to become cheaper here, then in the places from whence they are brought;</hi> Therefore <hi>This enterpriſe tendeth to abate the price of Commodity;</hi> and that ſtil more and more perpetually.</p>

                  <p>That is, when <hi>corn</hi> (or any proviſion fit to be ſtore up) is cheape in any Land or Nation whatſoever; it may by this meanes be bought up, and pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Bills (according to ſuch quantity as ſhall be allowed by authority) with which Bills (as with a new ſtock) men may continue to Trade, keeping their <hi>corn</hi> or ſuch like commodity, till a time of ſcarcity; And this will both affoard advantage to thoſe that ſtore it up, and help much to mitigate the dearth, which otherwiſe would ſometimes enſue.</p>
                  <p>For though, ſuch ſtoring up of <hi>corn</hi> or other proviſion, as it is managed by men looking ſolely at their own private advantage, is a practice much <hi>abuſed</hi> to the

                  <p>Therefore, <hi>this enterpriſe tendeth much to relieve the poor,</hi> which was the firſt thing to be proved.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, by mens putting their neereſt <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> that are deſtitute of any meanes of lively-hood into ſome credible way of <hi>imployment:</hi> For men that are rich themſelves, will be loath to ſee their neereſt <hi>relations</hi> periſh, (or to maintain them at their own charge,) when through a general quickneſſe of <hi>Trading,</hi> the meanes of putting them into a thriving Condition, is made Feaſible.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, through the abatement of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> whereby thoſe monied men who are deſtitute of the ſkill of any Trade (of which there are very many) would be glad to lend their ſtock upon reaſonable conditions, to ſuch honeſt and wel-governed perſons, as having ſkill in a Trade are out of preſent imployment, for want of ſtock of their own; And this no doubt would occaſion ſuch men to be ſought after, and put in a way, not onely of

                  </p>

            <p>But meeting in the very cloſe thereof, with a booke called <hi>conſuetudo vel lex Mercatoria, or, the Antient law Merchant,</hi> wherein the Author takes ſpeciall notice of the way of Trading uſed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> already by me mentioned, which is by accepting of the Bills of particular perſons, in ſtead of money, which he calls <hi>Bills Obligatory,</hi> it being, as in page 71 line 19. He affirmeth, the moſt uſual way of buying and ſelling Commodities beyond the ſeas, viz. At <hi>Amſerdam, Middleburrow, Hamburrow,</hi> and other places, I cannot but deſire it may be obſerved how exceedingly he (being a Merchant) not only commends (in ſeverall places of his book) this way of Trading but alſo doth plead for the uſe of the like practice here in England, as that which tends to many great and conſiderable advantages, chiefely to the benefit of Merchants, in order to the encreaſe of their
<hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to uſe his own words in page 73 line 1. If (ſaith he) this
<q>Man (viz. one who ſhould accept of theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> for <hi>Ware</hi> in ſtead of
<hi>money</hi> will not <hi>ride out</hi> (as they ſay) the time of the payment of the ſaid
<hi>Bills,</hi> he may go to another man and buy other commoditys therewith, as if it were with ready <hi>money</hi> the time onely conſidered; nay more, if he will have ready <hi>money</hi> for theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> he may ſell them to other Merchants that are monyed men, and abating for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> for the time, and commonly one moneth over, according to the rate as they can agree, and as money is plentifull, they ſhall have <hi>money</hi> at all times to imploy in <hi>Commodities,</hi> or to deliver by <hi>exchange,</hi> or to pay <hi>debts</hi> withall, or to carry <hi>home</hi> in ſpecie, or for any other purpoſe at their pleaſure, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170618:49"/>(ſaith he) is Commodious for many <hi>young Merchants,</hi> having ſmall ſtockes, as alſo for all men upon all occaſions; for it is properly as money paid by
<hi>aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> whereby great matters are compaſſed in the Trade of
<hi>Merchandize,</hi> the Commodities are ſooner <hi>vended</hi> in all places, the
<hi>Cuſtome</hi> and <hi>impoſition</hi> of Princes do encreaſe, the <hi>poor</hi> and
<hi>Mechanicall</hi> people are ſet on worke, men are better aſſured in their payments, the counterfeiting of <hi>Bills,</hi> and differences are prevented, the more <hi>Commodities</hi> are ſold, the leſſe <hi>ready money</hi> is <hi>tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and life is infuſed into
<hi>traffick</hi> and <hi>trade</hi> for the generall good; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (ſaith he) we ſee and may obſerve, that things which be <hi>indeed,</hi> and things which are not <hi>indeed,</hi> but taken to be <hi>Indeed,</hi> may produce all one effect; and every man is inabled with his own
<hi>meanes</hi> and <hi>credit,</hi> to augment <hi>Commerce.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By many ſuch arguments in diverſe parts of his Treatiſe he laboureth to preſs the uſe of this practiſe here in England, to which purpoſe ſee page 48. begining at line 53. page 71. line 49. page 73. line 43.</p>
            <p>I find in this Author likewiſe, many other things concerning <hi>exchange</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by
<hi>Bills of exchange.</hi> (as in Page 277. line 24. and page 275. &amp; 276, &amp; 277, &amp;
278, &amp; 279.) <hi>entereſt</hi> for monies, (page 223, and 224) Pawning of goods (page 227,
228, &amp; 229.) all tending to confirm the truth of what I have aſſerted in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Neither, do I find any thing at all by him affirmed, that doth ſeem (in the leaſt meaſure (to contradict what I have here purpoſed, ſave in this, that he takes the Vulgar opinion concerning <hi>plenty of money</hi> (that it makes things deer) for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without diſtinguiſhing of circumſtances or conſidering <hi>where, when</hi> or <hi>how,</hi> it may become the occaſion of encreaſing the <hi>plenty of Commodity,</hi> and inabling men by their
<hi>quick returnes,</hi> to take <hi>leſſe profit</hi> in the pound, and by conſequence, to ſell there ware cheaper then formerly.</p>
            <p>Now, I Confeſſe, it muſt needs be granted (as I have already obſerved) that where an encreaſe of <hi>money</hi> doth not occaſion a proportionable increaſe in the plenty of
<hi>commodity,</hi> it doth tend to cauſe an encreaſe in the price thereof; Yet the ſame Author in two ſeverall places where he ſaith, that plenty of <hi>money</hi> makes things deer, viz in page 45. line 5. and page 177. line 7. doth alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that plenty of
<hi>commodity</hi> makes them <hi>cheape:</hi> Now by his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, increaſe of money doth encreaſe Trading, which yet would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if it did not encreaſe mens Stocks and <hi>eſtates</hi> in <hi>commodity;</hi> that is, if it did not increaſe the <hi>plenty of commodity</hi> in a Land; and beſides, it is already proved that it is a rule amongſt Tradeſ-men to proportion their <hi>Stockes in commodity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quickneſſe or ſlowneſſe of <hi>Trading;</hi> ſo that plenty of <hi>commoditie</hi> (in any Land where Commodity enough is to be had for money or the beſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) muſt needs be the effect of a quick Trade, which is occaſioned by plenty of <hi>money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, if he had duely weighed, and had withall conſidered that ſcarcity of <hi>money</hi> is the meanes whereby obſtructing the ſale of <hi>Commodity,</hi> men through their ſlow
<hi>returnes</hi> are forced (for their meer ſubſiſtance) to take a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Profit</hi> in the pound, to the raiſing of the price of their <hi>Wares,</hi> the rather for that ſcarcity of <hi>money</hi> cauſing a high rate of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> doth inforce Tradeſ-men to advance their <hi>gaines per l.</hi> proportionably, as this Author himſelf urgeth in divers places viz. page 177. line 43. and Page 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. line 50.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (I ſay) if he had conſidered; he would without queſtion, have fully agreed unto what I have formerly obſerved to this purpoſe; beſides that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170618:49"/>this Enterpriſe being ordered ſo, as I have propoſed, tendeth to put ſome men into a capacity of thriving by <hi>underſelling</hi> others, which of it ſelf alone muſt needes be a moſt effectual meanes, to occaſion a conſiderable <hi>fall</hi> in the
<hi>price</hi> of <hi>Commodities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet if his bare <hi>affirmation</hi> without any argument, wherein he appears to be meerly ſwayed by the <hi>vulgar opinion,</hi> and the ſeeming probability of the thing (not diving ſeriouſly into the matter do bear more weight in the eye of any mans reaſon, then thoſe
<hi>arguments</hi> which I have aleaged to the contrary, let ſuch men take it for granted, that Commodities would by meanes of this <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe</hi> riſe in price; And yet nothing can be inferred from thence, to prove any, <hi>damage</hi> conſiderable to be incident to this,
<hi>undertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, though (as I have already obſerved,) <hi>Commodity</hi> were now <hi>ten times</hi> deerer then formerly, yet if a people have <hi>ten times</hi> as much <hi>money</hi> (or money worth) to purchaſe the ſame, the <hi>advantage</hi> in this caſe, muſt needs be as great as the <hi>inconvenience;</hi> eſpecially ſuch deerneſſe of <hi>commodity</hi> being (as the ſame Author affirmeth) a principall meanes to occaſion the <hi>importing of Bullion;</hi> by making the price of our <hi>Engliſh Commodities</hi> to riſe beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>And yet further, let it be remembred to this purpoſe, what I have already demonſtrated, viz. That it is a meer abſurdity to imagine that an increaſe of money ſhould occaſion an encreaſe in the price of <hi>commodities,</hi> fully <hi>proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to ſuch increaſe of money, becauſe in this caſe, ſuch increaſed <hi>Stocke of monies</hi> would go no further in the price of <hi>commodity</hi> then the former ſmal ſtock did, and conſequently would not encreaſe the <hi>ſate</hi> thereof, therefore would not at all encreaſe the price thereof.</p>
            <p>And as to the price of <hi>Engliſh Commodities</hi> beyond the Seas, it is clear, that they are deer or <hi>cheap</hi> in <hi>Forreign parts</hi> according to the <hi>rIches</hi> or
<hi>poverty</hi> of the people of this Land; for if the people of England be very <hi>poor</hi> (ſo as not being able to beſtow upon themſelves the <hi>tenth part</hi> perhaps of thoſe Commodities, which the fruits of our native <hi>ſoil</hi> would affoard, and which if their Trading and by conſequence their riches were multiplyed proportionably they would gladly ſpend amongſt themſelves in a <hi>Comfortable ſubſiſtance,</hi> in this caſe, the overplus of Commodities are ſent to other Nations, which doth occaſion ſuch plenty of <hi>Engliſh commodities,</hi> in other parts, as the price thereof beyond the ſeas muſt needs fall accordingly; Whereas if through the <hi>expences</hi> of the people of this Land, there were little of our own commodities to be spared for <hi>Tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it muſt needs be acknowledged that the <hi>ſcarcity</hi> of our Commodities beyond-ſea, would make them <hi>dear</hi> in Forreign parts, and by conſequence would be as means to occaſion the <hi>importing of Bullion,</hi> as followes from what I have already proved to that effect. In which reſpect, whether commodities grow <hi>deerer,</hi> or <hi>cheaper</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> then now they are; it will be no more conſiderable then whether we agree to meaſure our cloths and ſtuffs by the <hi>yard</hi> or by the <hi>ell,</hi> in eaſe we can but procure <hi>wands</hi> enough, of an ell long to meaſure them by.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore, that ſomething to the ſame purpoſe which I here propoſe, hath bin and ſtill is practiſed by Merchants in <hi>Forreign parts,</hi> to the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Trade, and would (as this Author teſtifies) tend as much to the benefit of this Nation, as I am confident, all judicious men muſt needs acknowledge.</p>
            <p>And conſidering that <hi>this Enterpriſe</hi> may (according to what I have propoſed) be both <hi>begun</hi> and carryed on, by a very ſmal number of men agreeing together; I hope the people of this Land, (and chiefely the Merchants of London, whom
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170618:50"/>it moſt concernes) will not ſhew themſelves more negligent of the meanes of their own <hi>neceſſary</hi> preſervation, then all other people in the world beſides, when it is well known, that as things now ſtand in England, we are in as much need of uſing our
<hi>utmoſt endeavours,</hi> for huſbanding matters to the beſt advantage for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of
<hi>Trade,</hi> as ever any people were.</p>
            <p>And if for the ſtirring up of this <hi>endeavour,</hi> amongſt the people of this Nation, God ſhall make uſe of theſe my poor labours; I ſhall think my ſelf happy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far forth ſerviceable to the publique: Howſoever, having now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which I am certain, would tend effectually to the introducing of all thoſe particulars declared in the
<hi>Title-page,</hi> and cleared the ſeveral conſequences thereof ſo, as it doth manifeſtly appear, that there wants nothing, but the meer <hi>conſent of men,</hi> whereby to inveſt themſelves with the full accompliſhment of thoſe conſiderable advantages, which to all lovers of their Country, (yea of themſelves) cannot chooſe but be (in referrence to
<hi>riches,</hi> and in great meaſure to <hi>peace,</hi>) the moſt deſireable and important amongſt all things that are <hi>earthly,</hi> in regard eſpecially, of the ſtate of affaires in this Nation at preſent, I could judge it no other, then my duty to lay down the ſame to publique <hi>view,</hi> leaving the iſſue wholely to God the Author of all goodneſſe; unto whom alone all glory (as in duty) be aſcribed, for theſe and all other the <hi>tenders</hi> and
<hi>proffers,</hi> which he makes of any <hi>favours, Benefits</hi> or <hi>bleſſings,</hi> conducing to the <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward</hi> weale of Mankind.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot but acknowledge it worthy ſerious conſideration, that the ſame providence which hath thus far carryed on my weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſhould at the very time of publiſhing thereof, put it into the hearts of the Parliament, by an Act for Advancing and regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trade of this Common-Wealth, to Authorize Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in order thereunto; that (amongſt other things) they might adviſe, how new waies may be found out, for the better venting of Commodities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſame accordingly.</p>
            <p>And for that a great part of this Treatiſe, was printed divers moneths before the coming forth of the aforeſaid Act, when there was no Authority under the Parliament, to whom I could properly addreſs my ſelf, for the furtherance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I thought no meanes more effectual, to make way for the promoting of theſe my endeavours, then to dedicate the ſame to the Parliament, and preſent divers members thereof, with ſeveral of the title-pages, wherein the effect of the whole
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170618:50"/>treatiſe is compriſed, to the intent that if they thought it convenient, they might be inſtrumental for the advancement of <hi>Trade,</hi> and the procuring of ſome Act in order thereunto; unto whom therefore I acknowledge my ſelf, in this particular much obliged.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt confeſſe, that if I had not intended this work, chiefely fotr he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the vulgar, and confuting (if poſſible) all gainſayers, (endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proofe of thoſe things, which otherwiſe I ſhould have thought evident enough of themſelves) but had prepared the ſame meerly for the peruſal of ſuch, as (doubtleſſe) are better acquainted with the grounds and principles of traffick, then I my ſelf, much of this pains might have bin ſpared, and the particulars ſaid down with greater brevity.</p>
            <p>But being ſenſible, that this Treatiſe (as it is at preſent) is ſcarce ripe for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique view, in reſpect of ſome impertinences (beſides divers remarkeable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caps, through negligence of the printer, both in words and ſentences) which I muſt needs ſay, might have bin (by a more retired and deliberate reviſall, in great meaſure) prevented, and the whole matter better digeſted, had not my proceedings therein, been by much other publique imployment, interrupted.</p>
            <p>Yet, conſidering the neceſſity of a ſpeedy promoting ſome ſuch effectual courſe as this, in regard of the languiſhing eſtate of Trade in this Land, and eſpecially ſeeing God by his good providence, doth now make inquiry after things of this nature, even from Authority; I have reſolved in relation to my duty, rather to let it thus eſcape in this rough draught, then meerly for concealing mine own private imperfections, either to omit or defer, the firſt, or leaſt opportunity of doing good to the publique.</p>
            <p>My onely requeſt therefore, of this Honourable Councel is, that ye would vouchſafe ſo far forth, to teſtifie your acceptance of my reall intentions in theſe my poor indeavors, as notwithſtanding either the prolixity thereof, or the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of your other publique affaires, to ſpare a little time and pains in ſome ſerious manner, for peruſing the fame; and then I hope, that God, by your due conſideration of, and ſympathizing with the diſtreſſed condition of this Nation, through the decay of Trade,) will move your hearts to improve your preſent call and truſt, by the ſpeedyeſt and utmoſt promoting of whatſoever juſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, ſhall conduce to publique advantage, for the reliefe of this afflicted people.</p>
            <p>And if I may here, ad ſome few lines by way of digreſſion, I am much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incouraged, to expect a bleſſing upon your actings, in order to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade; in regard that the generality of the people of this generation, have made ſuch an Idoll of him, who was guilty of the blood of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Saints and others, as I am confident many of thoſe wretchs, though they had certainly known, by teſtimony from heaven, that God had hated his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet they would ſtill rather have bin on his ſide then on Gods. So that if God by his juſt providence, ſhould now (in ſpight of all their maledictions, for that which they would have as murder, to be revenged from heaven, by evill ſucceſſe) bleſſe this nation with greater riches and proſperity then ever before, even under that very ſame Authority, who were the inſtruments of doing juſtice upon him, what a teſtimony would it be of Gods high diſpleaſure, againſt ſuch obſtinate Idoliters?</p>
            <p>Whereby, though (in that condition) they have no hope but in this life, yet ſo great is their malice, as they would accompt all their own ſhar in earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings (proceeding to them by meanes of ſuch inſtruments) to be more greevous then the greateſt adverſity whatſoever: which (amongſt many other arguments)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170618:51"/>doth induce me verily to believe, that God as he hath with a high hand juſtified the Parliament (againſt ſuch vain expectation of heavens revenge, upon their pretended murder) in the late unparrelleld ſucceſſes of our armies; will not fail ſtill marvellouſly to proſper the ſame Authority, by making them the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of wealth as well as conqueſt, to the yet greater vexation and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all ſuch unplacable and malicious enemies, to God and his people. If therefore in this hopeful attempt, God ſhall ſee good to make you thus Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, it will be a ſpecial means, whereby (amongſt a multitude of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantages, mentioned throughout this Treatiſe,) the Parliament, to the honour of this Counſell) will in great meaſure gain the Peoples affections: And by encouraging ſuch undertakings as this, every one willing to ſpend time, ſtrength, and eſtate, upon things publickly uſeful, will find it not to be in vain; which that it may effectually appear is my earneſt deſire, who, I truſt am with all due reſpects to this Honourable Councell, no leſſe in affection then duty.</p>
